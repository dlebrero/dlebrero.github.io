					<div class="entry-content"><p>These are my notes on Jerry Weinberg’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3axWJ6X">Becoming a technical leader</a>. </p><p>This is the first book that I read about leadership, so even if I found it insightful, I do not have any other reference to compare against. </p><h1>Key Insights</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Leadership is a skill and as with any skill it can be learn.</li>
  <li>Leadership is not an instinct.</li>
  <li>Leadership is the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered.</li>
  <li>Organic leadership leads to the process, not the people.</li>
  <li>An environment must have <em>MOI</em>:
  <ul>
    <li>Motivation - why.</li>
    <li>Organisation - to move ideas to practice.</li>
    <li>Ideas or Innovation - seeds, vision.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Motivational leadership is just one type of leadership.</li>
  <li>Technical leaders emphasise innovation. A problem-solving leadership style consist on:
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the problem.</li>
    <li>Manage flow of ideas.</li>
    <li>Maintain quality.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>All problem-solving leadership leaders have faith that there is always a better way.</li>
  <li>Manager != Leader. Manager is an appointed leader.</li>
  <li>Best working groups, leadership comes from everybody.</li>
  <li>The paradox of the appointed leader:
  <ul>
    <li>We think the appointed leader is the essential part of an organisation, so</li>
    <li>When there is trouble, everybody turns to the appointed leader, so</li>
    <li>This increases the load on her, so she either:
    <ul>
      <li>Breaks, or</li>
      <li>If she does not break, she has been the most active during the crisis, so</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The paradox if reinforced, as she is seen as the essential part during the crisis.</li>
    <li>This is why appointed leaders are replaced when a team does not perform. This is a fallacy. Systems are not linear.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Will I lose my technical skills if I become a leader?
  <ul>
    <li>Yes.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="#ch-6">Obstacles for innovation</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>No-problem syndrome.</li>
    <li>Self-blindness.</li>
    <li>Single solution belief.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Becoming a leader means shifting the focus from your ideas to ideas of others.</li>
  <li>People without vision cannot influence others.</li>
  <li>Find a vision: child-like, but not childish.</li>
  <li>Clear communication, tell:
  <ul>
    <li>What you perceive.</li>
    <li>How you feel about what you perceive.</li>
    <li>How you feel about the feeling.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If you are a leader, the people are your work. There is no other work worth doing.</li>
  <li>Offer to help only if you would want to be helped in the same situation and do it in the way you would want to be helped.</li>
  <li>You cannot care for others if you don’t care for yourself.</li>
  <li>Everybody wants to feel useful.</li>
  <li><a href="#mature-patterns">Mature patterns of behaviour</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ch-17">Consensus in organizations</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ch-18">Obstacles for organizing</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Not using people’s judgement.</li>
    <li>The more precise your orders, the more frustration when they are not understood, and the less creativity for the one ordered.</li>
    <li>Doing the work yourself
    <ul>
      <li>A leaders job is not to solve a single problem, but to create an environment in which many problems will be solved, not just for today, but for the future.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Everybody is doing their best, under the current circumstances. Hence if you think they there are not, it is because you don’t understand the circumstances.</li>
  <li>The person at the top makes the rules, which is another way of saying it breaks the old rules.</li>
  <li>If you don’t fail, you are not testing yourself thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Take responsibility for your own education.</li>
  <li>Make the most of your organisation’s learning opportunities.</li>
  <li>Make time: Don’t redo work you have assigned to others. Allow if you must make them mistakes.</li>
  <li>Seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness.</li>
  <li>Do not obsess to become a manager or leader. Ask yourself:
  <ul>
    <li>Why do I want to do this?</li>
    <li>What assets do I have to contribute?</li>
    <li>What liabilities do I bring?</li>

</ul><h1><a name="part-one"></a>Part one: Definition</h1><h2><a name="ch-1"></a>Chapter 1 - What is Leadership, Anyway?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Leadership is a skill and as with any skill it can be learn.</li>
  <li>Leadership is not an instinct.</li>
  <li>You maybe a reluctant leader, because leading is conceived as “telling people what to do”, which feels wrong.</li>
  <li>You are a leader if people comes to ask for advice, and you like that.</li>
  <li>Who is the leader of a team? You cannot ask the team or the observers of a team.</li>
  <li>Leadership means influence.</li>
  <li>Many model of leadership:
  <ul>
    <li>Linear:
    <ul>
      <li>one effect, one cause.</li>
      <li>Example: thread/reward.</li>
      <li>You feel stupid if it doesn’t work.</li>
      <li>Person:
      <ul>
        <li>Place individual into categories.</li>
        <li>“Growth” == how well you fit into a category.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Relationship:
      <ul>
        <li>Good for large scale.</li>
        <li>Your position == your authority.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Change:
      <ul>
        <li>Expect change to be orderly, one thing at a time.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Organic:
    <ul>
      <li>close to system thinking.</li>
      <li>One effect, hundreds of causes, including the passage of time.</li>
      <li>Good for complex situations.</li>
      <li>Bad if we become paralysed until we fully understand the problem.</li>
      <li>Person:
      <ul>
        <li>Are unique.</li>
        <li>Find common ground.</li>
        <li>Help find inner harmony.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Relationship:
    <ul>
      <li>Everybody is equal.</li>
      <li>Everybody benefits of problem solving.</li>
      <li>Joy of discovery.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Change:
    <ul>
      <li>Expect change to be messy, ambiguity.</li>
      <li>Change is an opportunity to grow.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Definition of Leadership:
  <ul>
    <li>Is the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered.</li>
    <li>Organic leadership leads to the process, not the people.</li>
    <li>Organic model is important for innovation.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-2"></a>Chapter 2 - Models of Leadership Style</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For change to happen, an environment must have <em>MOI</em>:
  <ul>
    <li>Motivation - why.</li>
    <li>Organisation - to move ideas to practice.</li>
    <li>Ideas or Innovation - seeds, vision.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Leadership style is how much of the above you use.</li>
  <li>Examples:
  <ul>
    <li>Pure “M”: Politician able to sell any idea.</li>
    <li>Pure “O”: Supper efficient office manager, for last year problems.</li>
    <li>Pure “I”: Genius that cannot work with others neither can organise the work for his ideas.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Technical leaders emphasise innovation. A problem-solving leadership style consist on:
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the problem.</li>
    <li>Manage flow of ideas.</li>
    <li>Maintain quality.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The above is accomplished with MOI strategies.</li>
  <li>To improve leadership, we ADD strategies, do not remove.</li>
  <li>All problem-solving leadership leaders have faith that there is always a better way.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-3"></a>Chapter 3 - A Problem-Solving Style</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the problem:
  <ul>
    <li>Read the spec.</li>
    <li>Encourage others to read the spec.</li>
    <li>Resolve arguments by referring back to the original spec.</li>
    <li>Seek clarification from customer.</li>
    <li>Refer back to the spec after some work has been done.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Manage flow of ideas:
  <ul>
    <li>Contribute with a clever idea.</li>
    <li>Encourage copying of useful idea.</li>
    <li>Elaborate on an idea that a teammate contributed.</li>
    <li>Drop one’s idea in favour of an idea the team want to develop.</li>
    <li>Refuse to let an idea drop until everybody understands it.</li>
    <li>Resist time pressure and take time to listen when other people explain their ideas.</li>
    <li>Test ideas contributed by other people (outside teams or company).</li>
    <li>Withhold quick criticism of teammates ideas, in order to keep ideas flowing.</li>
    <li>Criticise an idea, not the person behind the idea.</li>
    <li>Test your own ideas before offering them.</li>
    <li>When time and labor are running short, stop working in new ideas and just pitch in.</li>
    <li>Encourage the team to drop ideas that succeeded earlier, but cannot be extended to the new situation.</li>
    <li>Revive a dropped idea later, when it has value for other part of the problem or different context.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Control quality:
  <ul>
    <li>Measure quality as the project proceeds.</li>
    <li>Design tools and processes to measure quality as you build a solution.</li>
    <li>Measure the speed of implementation. Compare it to the schedule and be prepared to change the solution procedure.</li>
    <li>Step back from the project to refresh your perspective and assess its viability.</li>
    <li>Check ideas with the customer before implementing them.</li>
    <li>Restore morale when an idea collapses.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-4"></a>Chapter 4 - How Leaders Develop</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice makes perfect.</li>
  <li>Learning is like:</li>
</ul><p><img src="/images/blog/becoming-technical-leader/learning-curve.jpg" alt="Learning curve" title="Learning curve" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Huge jumps in productivity.</li>
  <li>Ravine before breakthrough.</li>
  <li>Plateau with little improvement.</li>
  <li>How do you know there is something after the ravine?</li>
  <li>Metacycle: learning to learn.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-5"></a>Chapter 5 - But I can’t because …</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am not a manager
  <ul>
    <li>Manager != Leader.</li>
    <li>Manager is an appointed leader.</li>
    <li>We tend to forget things that do not work, things that do not fit our models.</li>
    <li>Best working groups, leadership comes from everybody.</li>
    <li>The paradox of the appointed leader:
    <ul>
      <li>We think the appointed leader is the essential part of an organisation, so</li>
      <li>When there is trouble, everybody turns to the appointed leader, so</li>
      <li>This increases the load on her, so she either:
      <ul>
        <li>Breaks, or</li>
        <li>If she does not break, she has been the most active during the crisis, so</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The paradox if reinforced, as she is seen as the essential part during the crisis.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>This is why appointed leaders are replaced when a team does not perform. This is a fallacy. Systems are not linear.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>I am not the leader type
  <ul>
    <li>Motivational leadership is just one type of leadership.</li>
    <li>Problem-solving leadership is more appropriate for me.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>I will lose my technical skills
  <ul>
    <li>Yes you will.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>I am in danger of growing
  <ul>
    <li>Yes.</li>
    <li>But you can chose when.</li>
    <li>Again, manager != leader != boss.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>I don’t want that much power
  <ul>
    <li>What BS is the author talking about?</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h1><a name="part-2"></a>Part 2: Innovation</h1><h2><a name="ch-6"></a>Chapter 6 - Obstacles to Innovation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Self-blindness:
  <ul>
    <li>The only way we can see ourselves is through other people, so</li>
    <li>Find somebody to watch over you and give you honest feedback. Keep it mutual.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>No-problem syndrome:
  <ul>
    <li>What:
    <ul>
      <li>Finding a solution before understanding the problem.</li>
      <li>You know the answer to all problems.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Test to find out:
    <ul>
      <li>Ask the problem solver to repeat back the problem to be solved.</li>
      <li>If she replies with a solution, then she has the problem solver syndrome.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Single solution belief:
  <ul>
    <li>Just one solution.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-7"></a>Chapter 7 - Improve self-awareness</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Test if you want to change: start writing a personal journey for the next 3 months.</li>
  <li>When? Whenever fits you.</li>
  <li>What? About yourself.
  <ul>
    <li>Maybe follow: facts, feelings, findings.</li>
    <li>Maybe: work ideas and fixed bugs.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-8"></a>Chapter 8 - Developing Idea Power</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You must believe that any real problem has one more solution, which nobody has found yet.</li>
  <li>New ideas:
  <ul>
    <li>Every mistake is a new idea.</li>
    <li>Steal ideas:
    <ul>
      <li>Plagiarising.</li>
      <li>Research.</li>
      <li>Talks to others to be able to do this!</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Misunderstand stolen ideas.</li>
    <li>Copulation:
    <ul>
      <li>Mix two ideas into a better one.</li>
      <li>Coupling of ideas.</li>
      <li>Best way to solve arguments between two parties.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Error, theft and copulation: all things that we learn not to do since school.</li>
  <li>Relation with 3 obstacles to innovations:
  <ul>
    <li>Error == self-awareness: we do not error.</li>
    <li>Theft == no-problem syndrome: we are so clever that we do not need others ideas.</li>
    <li>Copulation == single-solution belief: if there is only one solution, there is no point on mixing.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-9"></a>Chapter 9 - Vision</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Becoming a leader means shifting the focus from your ideas to ideas of others.</li>
  <li>Success can lead to failure.</li>
  <li>People become leaders because the way they react to failure:
  <ul>
    <li>Not only overcome adversity, but turn it to their advantage.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>How? Special kind of vision, one that combines:
  <ul>
    <li>“Ordinary” mission in life.</li>
    <li>And personalising the vision.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>In other words, something worth doing, but must have a unique part that only I can contribute.</li>
  <li>People without vision cannot influence others.</li>
  <li>Find a vision: child-like, but not childish .</li>
</ul><h1><a name="part-3"></a>Part 3 - Motivation</h1><h2><a name="ch-10"></a>Chapter 10 - First Great Obstacle to Motivation - clear communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Inability to see yourself as others see you.</li>
  <li>Top problem solvers tend to believe that they had success without other people help. When they become leaders, they act more like a chief surgeon than an athletic coach. Basically, they think teammates cannot solve problems</li>
  <li>Testing question: Are you willing to appear fooling in front of other peoples?</li>
  <li>An Satir’s interaction model:</li>
</ul><p><img src="/images/blog/becoming-technical-leader/interaction-model.jpg" alt="Interaction model" title="Interaction model" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Inner me steps:
  <ul>
    <li>Sensory input.</li>
    <li>Interpretation.</li>
    <li>Feelings.</li>
    <li>Feeling about feelings.</li>
    <li>Defense.</li>
    <li>Rules for commenting.</li>
    <li>Outcome.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>This is just the receiving part, the sending part goes through something similar, so the opportunity of misunderstanding is big.</li>
  <li>Reasons why communications go awry:
  <ul>
    <li>Perception.</li>
    <li>Wrong time.</li>
    <li>Wrong place.</li>
    <li>Wrong person.</li>
    <li>Self-worth.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Satir says that 90% of communications are incongruent.</li>
  <li>Incongruent comms are deadly for motivation.</li>
  <li>Clear communication, tell:
  <ul>
    <li>What you perceive.</li>
    <li>How you feel about what you perceive.</li>
    <li>How you feel about the feeling.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>By telling all of these, you may look as a fool, that why the testing question.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-11"></a>Chapter 11 - Second great obstacle to motivation - Putting task over people</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pretend/Think that there is a conflict between people and a tasks. (Conflict == that you have to chose one over the other).</li>
  <li>People and tasks are indivisible. They cannot be separated.</li>
  <li>Every task derives from people.</li>
  <li>Lessons of task vs people oriented leaders:
  <ul>
    <li>When survivals is concerned, there is no choice but to put people first.</li>
    <li>If the job is not highly technical, the leader need not to be competent, but can lead by fear.</li>
    <li>People with strong technical background can convert any task into a technical task, thus avoiding work they don’t want to do.</li>
    <li>Leaders who don’t care about people don’t have anyone to lead, unless their followers don’t have a choice.</li>
    <li>No amount of caring for people will hold your audience if you have nothing to offer.</li>
    <li>Task-oriented leaders tend to overestimate their own accomplishments.</li>
    <li>Very little work we do is really so important that it justifies sacrificing the future possibilities of the people doing the work.</li>
    <li>When the work is complex, no leader can be absolutely sure that plans won’t “gang aft agley”.</li>
    <li>To be a successful problem-solving leader, you must keep everybody’s humanness at the forefront.</li>
    <li>If you are a leader, the people are your work. There is no other work worth doing.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-12"></a>Chapter 12 - The Problem of Helping Others</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You cannot help if people don’t want to be helped.</li>
  <li>Start by agreeing what is the problem.</li>
  <li>You can stop helping if it doesn’t work.</li>
  <li>In every offer to help, the helper expect to get something, even if he is not conscious.</li>
  <li>No matter how strange it may look, most people are actually trying to be helpful.</li>
  <li><p>Golden rule regarding help:</p>
  <blockquote>Offer to help only if you would want to be helped in the same situation and do it in the way you would want to be helped
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>If you don’t care about people whom you lead, you will never succeed as they leader.</li>
  <li>You cannot care for others if you don’t care for yourself.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-13"></a>Chapter 13 - Learning to Be a Motivator</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter about self-esteem: each of us have survival rules.</li>
  <li>Survival rules do not allow to be effective leader.</li>
  <li>We can change survival rules to guidelines.</li>
  <li>We also have meta-rules (rules about our survival rules) that govern how we can change our survival rules.</li>
  <li>So when your leadership is not working, maybe you need to find if there is a survival rule interfering.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-14"></a>Chapter 14 - Where Power Come From</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You don’t “possess” power. Power is a relationship.</li>
  <li>Example: Technical expertise is “power” in a team of junior people, while not so much in a team of senior.</li>
  <li>You need to understand what you want power for.</li>
  <li>When changing role, your old power will banish and a new one will emerge. This is because your relationship with others has changed.</li>
  <li>Personal power: when you have a clear understanding of what you really want.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-15"></a>Chapter 15 - Power, Imperfection and Congruence</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Everybody wants to feel useful.</li>
  <li>Mechanical problems: one that seem complex but turns out to be solved by a technical solution with no emotional or psychological turmoil.</li>
  <li>Some mechanical problems are hard to handle because of the reaction to the event.</li>
  <li><a name="mature-patterns"></a>List of mature patterns of behaviour, to help fixing a problem:
  <ul>
    <li>Be clear when dealing with others.</li>
    <li>Be aware of your own thoughts and feelings.</li>
    <li>Be able to see and hear what is outside yourself.</li>
    <li>Behave towards other people as separate from yourself and unique.</li>
    <li>Treat differentness as an opportunity to learn and explore rather than a threat or signal for conflict.</li>
    <li>Deal with persons and situations in their context, in terms of how it is rather how you wish it were or expect it to be.</li>
    <li>Accept responsibility for what you feel, think, hear and see, rather than denying it or attributing it to others.</li>
    <li>Have open techniques for giving, receiving and checking meaning with others.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>These are all social and communication skills.</li>
  <li>Be congruent.</li>
  <li>Be open with others about what you perceive, how you feel and be open to learn.</li>
</ul><h1><a name="part-4"></a>Part 4 - Organization</h1><h2><a name="ch-16"></a>Chapter 16 - Gaining organisation power</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Organisation power: to obtain resources (money, training, office space, tools) for your team.</li>
  <li>Power conversion: convert other kinds of power into organisational power.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-17"></a>Chapter 17 - Effective organisation of problem-solving teams</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Possible organisations:
  <ul>
    <li>Individual: no org, everybody works on its own.</li>
    <li>Voting: Vote without previous discussion.</li>
    <li>Strong leader: one person makes all decisions, privately consulting the team.</li>
    <li>Consensus: everybody agrees after the discussion:
    <ul>
      <li>Everybody agrees in principle.</li>
      <li>Everybody backs up the decision with logic and facts.</li>
      <li>Avoid changing your mind only to avoid conflict.</li>
      <li>Avoid techniques to reduce conflict (like voting, averaging, …)</li>
      <li>Facts and only facts.</li>
      <li>Consider other opinions helpful, as long as they are supported by facts and logic.</li>
      <li>Do not withhold information just to be nice.</li>
      <li>Can use intuition, but make it clear that is intuition.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Voting:
    <ul>
      <li>Better than individual.</li>
      <li>Require less time.</li>
      <li>No information exchange.</li>
      <li>Better than consensus, if consensus breaks down.</li>
      <li>Better than strong leader, if leader is bad.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Strong leader:
    <ul>
      <li>Depends a lot on the leadership style and knowledge of the leader.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Consensus:
    <ul>
      <li>At first, time consuming and frustrating.</li>
      <li>Usually highest quality decisions.</li>
      <li>Can be harmful if consensus process breaks down.</li>
      <li>Whole team feels responsible for the decision, so more productive.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Best one?
    <ul>
      <li>Depends on the organisation context.</li>
      <li>Remember that organisation context can change.</li>
      <li>To check if it is working, see if the organisation is providing an environment for people to understand the problem, manage the flow of ideas and maintain quality (== problem-solving org).</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-18"></a>Chapter 18 - Obstacles to Effective Organising</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First Obstacle: Believe that you just have two choices: order or be ordered.</li>
  <li>Second Obstacle: Think that people can take and interpret orders as computer.
  <ul>
    <li>People have judgement and you want them to use it.</li>
    <li>Communication is never perfect.</li>
    <li>The more precise your orders, the more frustration when they are not understood, and the less creativity for the one ordered.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Third: doing the work yourself.
  <ul>
    <li>A leaders job is not to solve a single problem, but to create an environment in which many problems will be solved, not just for today, but for the future.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Forth: Reward ineffective organising:
  <ul>
    <li>Reward heroics.</li>
    <li>Organizing is not about solving “crisis”/problems, but avoiding them.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Giving and taking orders are means to an end, not an end in themselves.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-19"></a>Chapter 19 - Learning to Be an Organiser</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice: at work and outside work.</li>
  <li>Observe how people organise and experiment (introduce little changes to observe what happens).</li>
  <li>Look for incongruences:
  <ul>
    <li>What things are vs the way they look. Example:
    <ul>
      <li>org chart vs real org.</li>
      <li>Official channels vs informal channels.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>(Seed model) Everybody is doing their best, under the current circumstances. Hence if you think they there are not, it is because you don’t understand the circumstances.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Look for cross wires:
  <ul>
    <li>If everybody is motivated, and</li>
    <li>If everybody is agrees on the problem</li>
    <li>Then look for a mistake/misunderstanding in the organisation.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Legitimize differences:
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes the cross wires happen because orgs do not account for people being different.</li>
    <li>Look at the Myers-Briggs model. Read “Please understand me”.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Use yourself as a model of the team.
  <ul>
    <li>You can see your own internal conflicts as a model of people conflicts.</li>
    <li>For example, conflict of wanting to finish now vs wanting to do a perfect job.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h1><a name="part-5"></a>Part 5 - Transformation</h1><h2><a name="ch-20"></a>Chapter 20 - How You Will Be Graded as a Leader</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Grading is multiplicative. If you have a 80% in tech and 60% people’s skill your score is 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48.</li>
  <li>This is because as a leader, people expects a lot more.</li>
  <li>To make things even harder, as a technical leader, you are going to be graded in more dimensions.</li>
  <li>Improving an are with the least grade has more impact.
  <ul>
    <li>From the previous example, if we can improve 10 points:
    <ul>
      <li>(0.8+0.1) * 0.6 = 0.8 * 0.6 + 0.1 * 0.6 = 0.54</li>
      <li>0.8 * (0.6+0.1) = 0.8 * 0.6 + 0.1 * 0.8 = 0.56</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Until some trust is build, tech leaders are scored by the minimum of the grades.
  <ul>
    <li>Try to delay the area that you are weak at.</li>
    <li>You don’t need to answer any question immediately.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-21"></a>Chapter 21 - Passing Your Own Leadership Tests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The person at the top makes the rules, which is another way of saying it breaks the old rules.</li>
  <li>A leadership trait is withstand testing, because you are going to be tested all the time.</li>
  <li>To pass a leadership test, you either use:
  <ul>
    <li>Motivation, also called personality style.</li>
    <li>Organisation, also called planning style.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Tech people are usually better at the planning style.</li>
  <li>Paradox: to avoid your weakest style, you have to strengthen it.</li>
  <li>Both style are important.</li>
  <li>If you don’t fail, you are not testing yourself thoroughly.</li>
  <li>If you are not testing yourself thoroughly, you will learn little.</li>
  <li>If you learn little, you can be good but not exceptional. You cannot jump to your next plateau.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-22"></a>Chapter 22 - A Personal Plan for Change</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When trying something new:
  <ul>
    <li>We are in a special state of alertness.</li>
    <li>When we stop paying attention, we go back to the old, safe behaviour.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>A series of small, ordinary changes can put you on the brink of a large and extraordinary one. You have to have the courage to take the plunge.</li>
  <li>You need a plan.</li>
  <li>Take responsibility for your own education.</li>
  <li>Make the most of your organisation’s learning opportunities.</li>
  <li>Learn your learning style.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-23"></a>Chapter 23 - Finding Time to Change</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make time:
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t redo work you have assigned to others. Allow if you must make them mistakes.</li>
    <li>Avoid trivial technical arguments to prove your technical superiority.</li>
    <li>Choose your own priorities and don’t wait for a crisis to organise your activities.</li>
    <li>Avoid administration.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to what you do when there is nothing to do.</li>
    <li>Listen to what other people has already learned.</li>
    <li>Do two things at once:
    <ul>
      <li>Find activities where you get multiple benefits.</li>
      <li>Kill two birds with one stone.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-24"></a>Chapter 24 - Finding Support for Change</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness.</li>
  <li>Nurture relationships for:
  <ul>
    <li>Technical support.</li>
    <li>Services you cannot perform (like criticism of your own writing).</li>
    <li>Growth: people that give you things you didn’t know you did want to know.</li>
    <li>Recovery, emotional and spiritual support.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>There are three types of supporters:
  <ul>
    <li>Conservatives: they don’t want you to change.</li>
    <li>Radicals: they want you to change.</li>
    <li>Friends: “Do whatever you really want to do”.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h1><a name="epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Do not obsess to become a manager or leader.</li>
  <li>Whenever you want to do something, ask yourself:
  <ul>
    <li>Why do I want to do this?</li>
    <li>What assets do I have to contribute?</li>
    <li>What liabilities do I bring?</li>
  </ul></li>
