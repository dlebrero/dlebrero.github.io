<blockquote><p>If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try <cite>Seth Godin</cite></p>
</blockquote><h1>Key Insights</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Meetings are how a lot of your work as a manager gets done.</li>
  <li>Core principle: keep as little information in your head as possible.</li>
  <li>To feel productive, use <a href="/2023/04/12/high-output-management-summary/#content">Andy Grove categories</a>.</li>
  <li>The ability to decide is a privilege that not everybody has.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place. <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Good comm is the connective tissue between everything you do as a manager:
  <ul>
    <li>Choose the right medium.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your mood.</li>
    <li>Think twice.</li>
    <li>Communication is not about you.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You do not delegate accountability
  <ul>
    <li>Never get frustrated and do it yourself.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Working with your manager:
  <ul>
    <li>Most important piece of advise: you should pull on your manager, not wait for them to push to you.</li>
    <li>Show an interest in their world: best source of info+ opportunities to grow.</li>
    <li>Weekly journaling.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>1-2-1:
  <ul>
    <li>It is the report’s meeting: they should talk 70% of the time.</li>
    <li>You are not a therapist. And you don’t have the qualifications.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="#zoneproximaldev">Zone of proximal development</a>.</li>
  <li>Two kinds of developers: Cathedral constructors and Bazaar Browsers.</li>
  <li>Performance review:
  <ul>
    <li>The people that benefit the most are the highest performing staff.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Too many seniors: too many strong opinions may cause conflict and disarray rather than getting there twice as fast.</li>
  <li>Culture fit is impossible as a concept: people instead add or contribute to a culture.</li>
  <li>Hiring: If you are on the fence, say no.</li>
  <li>Everybody that interviews for your company should be left with the impression that it is a great place to work.</li>
  <li>When fighting for someone to stay, are you willing to accept an imbalance to keep someone within your company?</li>
  <li>The bar that you set for acceptable performance is firmly fixed at the level of your worst performer.</li>
  <li>As with most issues with interpersonal relationships, open and honest comms is the remedy.</li>
  <li>“The team is not working hard enough” can mean: Lack of visible output, “hustle” or passion.</li>
  <li>You have to accept the fact that productivity per head will decrease as the company gets larger.</li>
  <li>Shift conversation towards trade-off.</li>
  <li>You need to ack as an information gatekeeper deciding what, when and how.</li>
  <li>In absence of information, people tend to assume the worst.</li>
  <li>Carve out 10% of your time each week to do absolutely nothing other than let your thoughts emerge.</li>
  <li>Progression framework should act as a compass rather than a GPS.</li>
  <li>A promotion should be a ratification of a position that has been almost reached.</li>
  <li>Framework to decide on pay increases:
  <ol>
    <li>Fix anyone underpaid according to market rate or their peers.</li>
    <li>Increase anyone promote to a new role.</li>
    <li>Inflation.</li>
    <li>Increase pay in line with performance.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Every job that you have should be a meaningful step towards the vision that you have for yourself in the future.</li>
  <li>People struggle to create a vision because:
  <ol>
    <li>They don’t dream big enough.</li>
    <li>They aren’t clear enough.</li>
  </ol></li>

<blockquote><p>If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try <cite>Seth Godin</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>First steps as a manager: create a snapshot of the team:
  <ol>
    <li>Your own observations, your manager’s and the team’s.</li>
    <li>30 mins 1-2-1 informal to chat about team responsibilities and current project, and to chat about what is/isn’t working at the team/company level.
    <ul>
      <li>Repeat any actions you are taking.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Book a weekly 1-2-1 with everyone is your team:
    <ul>
      <li>Meetings are how a lot of your work as a manager gets done.</li>
      <li>Book them at their convenience time.</li>
      <li>1 hour to start with.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Introductory meeting with your manager:
    <ul>
      <li>Find out current performance of team and individuals.</li>
      <li>Current project/work stream.</li>
      <li>Thoughts on how best to work with them.</li>
      <li>How to do your role in the org.</li>
      <li>Set up weekly 1-2-1 with them.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Create snapshot:<br /> <img src="/images/blog/books/become-effective-software-engineering-manager/team-snapshot.jpg" alt="team snapshot" /></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Poor communication downward: you and your manager share/agree but team is unaware/disagrees.</li>
  <li>Action List:
  <ul>
    <li>Items to talk with team: poor comms down, false beliefs.</li>
    <li>Items to talk with your manager: poor comms upwards, false beliefs.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-2"></a>Chapter 2 - Manager Yourself First</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Catastrophe doesn’t have to strike to feel like your work day was a waste of time.
  <ul>
    <li>You won’t survive without a system to org yourself.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>System to organise yourself:
  <ul>
    <li>Core principle: keep as little information in your head as possible.</li>
    <li>Tools:
    <ol>
      <li>Calendar:
      <ul>
        <li>Organizing your time.</li>
        <li>You should live your day by your calendar.</li>
        <li>There should be plenty of free space for others to book if they wish.</li>
        <li>Should contain only:
        <ul>
          <li>Meetings.</li>
          <li>Busy periods.</li>
          <li>Focus time.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Make it public to the org by default.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>TODO list:
      <ul>
        <li>Only place where your tasks live.</li>
        <li>If it is not on your TODO list, then you are not doing it.</li>
        <li>Asana.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Email Inbox:
      <ul>
        <li>Never delete email.</li>
        <li>Unsubscribe from lists you don’t read.</li>
        <li>Batch email sessions.</li>
        <li>Email is not your TODO list.</li>
        <li>All other SW should just email you.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Place to capture information:
      <ul>
        <li>For when you are away from your computer:
        <ul>
          <li>Notebook or phone.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Reasons managers do you feel unproductive:
  <ul>
    <li>You works through other people.</li>
    <li>You do dozens of little tasks rather than a few big ones.</li>
    <li>Context-switching and more likely to be interrupted.</li>
    <li>Loads of time in meetings and discussions.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>To feel productive, use <a href="/2023/04/12/high-output-management-summary/#content">Andy Grove categories</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Information gathering.</li>
    <li>Decision-making:
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to decide is a privilege that not everybody has.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Nudging:
    <ul>
      <li>Be aware that your word carries some authority, so bear that in mind when offering your opinion freely.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Being a role model.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Measure output as a manager (also from Andy Grove book):
  <ul>
    <li>The output of your team + the output of others that you influence.</li>
    <li>Your team’s output is more important than your own personal output:
    <ul>
      <li>More delegating, less doing.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h1><a name="p-2"></a>Part II - Working with Individuals</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If you thought that getting computers to do the right things was hard, wait until you start working more with humans.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-3"></a>Chapter 3 - Interfacing with Humans</h2>
<blockquote><p>The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place. <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Managers in the tech industry have a tooling crisis.</li>
  <li>Comms:
  <ul>
    <li>Good comm is the connective tissue between everything you do as a manager.</li>
    <li>Clear, candid and empathetic.</li>
    <li>First step is to choose the right medium. Depends on:
    <ul>
      <li>The message itself.</li>
      <li>The recipient.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Be mindful of your mood, it might be better to:
    <ul>
      <li>Delay next activity.</li>
      <li>Be upfront and share why, so the other person knows it has nothing to do with them.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Think twice before broadcasting information.</li>
    <li>Dont communicate when you want to, but when you need to.</li>
    <li>Radical candor: care personally (in their best interest) and challenge directly (get to the point).</li>
    <li>Communication is not about you.</li>
    <li>Bad traits:
    <ul>
      <li>Over communication.</li>
      <li>Waffling.</li>
      <li>Playing to the crowd.</li>
      <li>Inconsistency.</li>
      <li>Letting emotions get in the way.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Delegation:
  <ul>
    <li>You do not delegate accountability.</li>
    <li>Full delegation can only happen when the person being delegated to can perform that task exactly to the standard that you expect with no guidance.</li>
    <li>From less delegation to more, from more control to less:
    <ul>
      <li>You do it (no delegation):</li>
      <li>You show them how to do it.</li>
      <li>They do it with your guidance.</li>
      <li>They do it with frequent check-ins.</li>
      <li>They do it with infrequent check-ins.</li>
      <li>They tell you when it is done.</li>
      <li>They do it (full delegation).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Never get frustrated and do it yourself.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Working with your manager:
  <ul>
    <li>Most important piece of advise: you should pull on your manager, not wait for them to push to you.</li>
    <li>Be proactive.</li>
    <li>Figure out:
    <ul>
      <li>What your performance equate to in their eyes.</li>
      <li>What is their performance depend upon?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Show an interest in their world: best source of info+ opportunities to grow.</li>
    <li>Weekly journaling:
    <ul>
      <li>Progress.</li>
      <li>Problems: what happen and what needs addressing.</li>
      <li>Plans: for the problems.</li>
      <li>People.</li>
      <li>Block 30 mins to do it.</li>
      <li>Write as if you were talking to a good friend.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-4"></a>Chapter 4 - One-to-Ones</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Contracting:
  <ul>
    <li>Set of questions for the first 1-2-1.</li>
    <li>Sets expectations on both sides.</li>
    <li>Both should answer:
    <ol>
      <li>Which ares would you like the most support with?</li>
      <li>How would you like to receive feedback and support?</li>
      <li>What could be a challenge of us working together?</li>
      <li>How might we know if the support I’m offering isn’t going well?</li>
      <li>How confidential is the content of our meetings?</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>It is the report’s meeting:
  <ul>
    <li>They should talk 70% of the time.</li>
    <li>Don’t solve their problems:
    <ul>
      <li>Ask more questions for them to arrive to their own conclusions.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Avoid status updates.</li>
  <li>You are not a therapist. And you don’t have the qualifications.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-5"></a>Chapter 5 - The Right Job for the Person</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is not about getting the right person for the job, it is about getting the right job for the person.</li>
  <li><a name="zoneproximaldev"></a>Zone of proximal development:
  <ul>
    <li>Area in which a person cannot progress without the help of a higher skilled individual.</li>
    <li>You have to give such tasks.</li>
    <li>You have to ensure higher skilled people can assist.</li>
    <li>Can be applied at the task and career levels.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Two kinds of developers:
  <ul>
    <li>Cathedral constructors:
    <ul>
      <li>Subject-matter experts.</li>
      <li>Deep, not wide knowledge.</li>
      <li>Teachers.</li>
      <li>Revel in the detail.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Bazaar Browsers:
    <ul>
      <li>Get as much newness as possible.</li>
      <li>Build and throw away.</li>
      <li>Avoid stagnation: wide, not deep.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-6"></a>Chapter 6 - The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Performance review:
  <ul>
    <li>Should be a two-way process.</li>
    <li>The people that benefit the most are the highest performing staff.</li>
    <li>For praise, critique, planning, career goals, and dreaming about the future.</li>
    <li>Every 6 months.</li>
    <li>Start 3 weeks before teh review meeting.</li>
    <li>Feedback from 2-5 peers:
    <ul>
      <li>What has this person excelled at?</li>
      <li>What should this person do differently and why?</li>
      <li>What other feedback would you like to give?</li>
      <li>Would you like to give this feedback anonymously?</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Review forms parts:
  <ul>
    <li>Fill and share 1 and 2 before the review meeting.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Your report’s observations:
    <ol>
      <li>Achievements:
      <ul>
        <li>This about your achievements big or small over the last six months. What have you accomplished that makes your proud and why?</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Reflection:
      <ul>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-7"></a>Chapter 7 - Join Us!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Too many seniors: too many strong opinions may cause conflict and disarray rather than getting there twice as fast.</li>
  <li>Culture fit is impossible as a concept: people instead add or contribute to a culture.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>About the company:

    <li>Funnel:
    <ol>
      <li>Review applications:

        <li>Aim is to know each other (past roles and experiences).</li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-8"></a>Chapter 8 - Game Over</h2>
<ul>
  <li>People will always leave.</li>
  <li>Good leavers:
  <ul>
    <li>Work out best date that work for both.</li>
    <li>Ask if they want a reference.</li>
    <li>Focus on handover.</li>
    <li>Keep the door open.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Bad reasons for leaving:
  <ul>
    <li>Zingers: lack of open and honest communication from both parties, which results in simmering issues not being caught early.</li>
    <li>Compensation.</li>
    <li>Issues with coworkers.</li>
    <li>Career progression.</li>
    <li>Lack of challenge or new experiences.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>When fighting for someone to stay, are you willing to accept an imbalance to keep someone within your company?</li>
  <li>The bar that you set for acceptable performance is firmly fixed at the level of your worst performer.</li>
  <li>Personal Improvement Plan (PIP):
  <ul>
    <li>When other means of improving a poor performance have failed.</li>
    <li>Contract terminated if PIP fails.</li>
    <li>Example page 161 and 162.</li>
    <li>It is in both your best interests in them to be able to succeed.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Layoffs:
  <ul>
    <li>You will typically be given some script to follow that details the reasoning plus their severance package. If not, you have the right to ask for once.</li>
    <li>This is one of the hardest things to do as a manager, but they will be hurting more.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-9"></a>Chapter 9 - How to Win Friends and Influence People</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Being well-connected means more opportunities to have a positive impact on more people.
  <ul>
    <li>Influencing others positively builds stronger connections.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3AOugcB">Only the Paranoid Survive</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Snow melts at the periphery. Employees on the periphery of the business see the real situation in the market much quicker than you do.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Don’t be afraid of “cold email” introductions:
  <ul>
    <li>Check in via email or coffee regularly (once a month).</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Mentorship agreement:
  <ul>
    <li>Before the first meeting.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Time: when, where and for how long the relationship would last.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: can the mentee contact at any time? What medium?</li>
    <li>What is confidential.</li>
    <li>Boundaries.</li>
    <li>Review and evaluation: when to stop.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Two modes of conversation:
  <ul>
    <li>Directive.</li>
    <li>Following interest: listening to understand, reflecting on what they are saying, and summarizing.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Coaching:
  <ul>
    <li>Mostly following interest, with the occasional directive if they are getting nowhere.</li>
    <li>For structured coaching sessions, use GROW:
    <ul>
      <li>Goal: what problem are we trying to solve?</li>
      <li>Reality: who, what, where, and how much?</li>
      <li>Options.</li>
      <li>Wrap-up: clear choice, and discuss what support is needed.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h1><a name="p-3"></a>Part III - The Bigger Picture</h1><h2><a name="ch-10"></a>Chapter 10 - Humans Are Hard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Increasingly senior positions invite more scrutiny.</li>
  <li>Your staff reaction when you have a bad day:
  <ul>
    <li>Kindness and understanding: you have a fantastic squad, and you are doing a good job.</li>
    <li>Concern and worry: reassure them it is nothing to do with them.</li>
    <li>Resentment: It often isn’t entirely about you. Dig deeper in your conversations.</li>
    <li>Mutiny: danger zone. It never ends well for anyone involved.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>As with most issues with interpersonal relationships, open and honest comms is the remedy.</li>
  <li>As a manager, you have to shield your team from input that is too messy, disruptive, and emotional when it will disrupt their job:
  <ol>
    <li>Listen and observe without judgement.
    <ul>
      <li>Separate facts from emotions.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Digest:
    <ul>
      <li>Give yourself time before communicating downwards.</li>
      <li>What the facts (not the emotions) really mean?</li>
      <li>Which individuals will react badly? Why?</li>
      <li>Sleep over it.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Communicate:
    <ul>
      <li>Consider reframming the message into something more positive.</li>
      <li>Decide the best medium.</li>
      <li>Never shy away from the facts.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>“The team is not working hard enough” can mean:
  <ol>
    <li>Lack of visible output.</li>
    <li>Lack of “hustle”.</li>
    <li>Lack of passion.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Being a good manager is about turning the whip into a carrot.
  <ul>
    <li>You should be creating the conditions that make your staff happy and productive through nurturing their autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Dunning-Kruger effect leads to:
  <ol>
    <li>Pool decisions by junior engineers:
    <ul>
      <li>Ideally, coach them so they figure out themselves that they are overconfident.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Rash decisions by senior staff:
    <ul>
      <li>Present only the facts.</li>
      <li>Consider taking the conversation offline.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Imposter syndrome:
  <ul>
    <li>Junior: pair with senior staff who can show the junior that they are doing a great job will build their confidence.</li>
    <li>Senior:
    <ul>
      <li>Pair them with junior: they will realize just how much they have to teach.</li>
      <li>If they are reserved, ask their opinion directly in debates.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-11"></a>Chapter 11 - Projects Are Hard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When high-stakes projects are handled correctly, you will be looking at career growth.</li>
  <li>At times of immense pressure:
  <ul>
    <li>Over-communicate.</li>
    <li>Open a clear comm channel.</li>
    <li>Release frequently.</li>
    <li>Be pragmatic == create tech debt.</li>
    <li>Set example.</li>
    <li>Afterwards:
    <ul>
      <li>Celebrate.</li>
      <li>Pay tech debt.</li>
      <li>Do a retro.</li>
      <li>Allow for self-guided time.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Adding more person-power to a team/department/org makes everything more complicated.</li>
  <li>If you are successful:
  <ul>
    <li>Business as usual gets harder:
    <ul>
      <li>Just keeping the lights on takes an increasing amount of time and effort.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>More and more legacy code.</li>
    <li>Comms and process overhead are ever-increasing.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You have to accept the fact that productivity per head will decrease as the company gets larger.</li>
  <li>Scope, resources, time triangle:
  <ul>
    <li>You don’t want to compromise quality.</li>
    <li>Scoping:
    <ul>
      <li>MosCoW.</li>
      <li>Stretch goal.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Resources:
    <ul>
      <li>How much work can be done in parallel?
      <ul>
        <li>Without stepping into each other’s code.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>What technical competency is required?</li>
      <li>If shit hits the fan, moving people around isn’t your strongest lever to pull.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Time: find out the impact of the deadline moving.</li>
    <li>Shift conversation towards trade-off.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-12"></a>Chapter 12 - The Information Stock Exchange</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As a manager, information is your currency. But not all information is good.</li>
  <li>Never be a spy.</li>
  <li>You need to ack as an information gatekeeper deciding what, when and how.</li>
  <li>Unless there is a critical reason for hiding information, it should be shared, although care should be taken in how the message is delivered.</li>
  <li>You must be consistent with how you treat information with different people.</li>
  <li>You always share just enough.</li>
  <li>Information classification:
  <ul>
    <li>Completely confidential.</li>
    <li>Closed box.</li>
    <li>Open box.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>In absence of information, people tend to assume the worst.</li>
  <li>Politics in the workspace are always going to happen:
  <ul>
    <li>They arise because of tension between different types of social structures:
    <ul>
      <li>The org chart.</li>
      <li>Close-knit informal groups.</li>
      <li>Influential people.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Good use of politics: Identify who you can collaborate with on different issues with the least amount of friction.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-13"></a>Chapter 13 - Letting Go of Control</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As a manager, you do work through other people, and they are going to do it in a different way than how you’d have done it.</li>
  <li>Stoicism:
  <ul>
    <li>Live in the present, in accordance with nature.</li>
    <li>Use logic and reasoning.</li>
    <li>Negative visualization: appreciate more what we have.</li>
    <li>Denying of some pleasures:
    <ul>
      <li>Enjoy them more.</li>
      <li>Increase self-discipline.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Not worry about things that are out of your control.</li>
    <li>For the things you have some, but not complete control, you should set internal goals rather than external ones.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Carve out 10% of your time each week to do absolutely nothing other than let your thoughts emerge.</li>
  <li>Purposefully take on 85% of the work that you think that you can get done.</li>
  <li>Practice and a good night’s sleep makes perfect.</li>
  <li>Sleep, exercise, meditate.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-14"></a>Chapter 14 - Good Housekeeping</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Getting comms right sounds a lot like network routing: unicast, broadcast, multicast.</li>
  <li>Cross-functional feature teams without effective comms are just another type of silo.</li>
  <li>Guilds:
  <ul>
    <li>Discussion and progression of best practices.</li>
    <li>Information sharing across multiple teams.</li>
    <li>Improving the visibility of that interest or discipline within the company.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Lightning talks:
  <ul>
    <li>5 minutes.</li>
    <li>30-1h to prepare.</li>
    <li>Simple slides: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method">Takahashi</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">Pecha Kucha</a>.</li>
    <li>Practice multiple times.</li>
    <li>Have a system of feedback for the speaker.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Consider a Kanban with management “bugs” that anybody can add to.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-15"></a>Chapter 15 - Dual Ladders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The most surefire way of a manager increasing their output is for their team to get bigger.</li>
  <li>More seniority:
  <ul>
    <li>Increasingly effective at delegation (including whole teams).</li>
    <li>More people reporting to them.</li>
    <li>Larger and more important strategic areas.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Progression framework should act as a compass rather than a GPS:
  <ul>
    <li>Competencies should be defined in a way that doesn’t make them specific checkboxes to tick to unlock a promotion.</li>
    <li>For the managers one, start with the same as IC, with the difference that instead of employing these skills to build SW, managers are using them to build people.</li>
    <li>A promotion should be a ratification of a position that has been almost reached.</li>
    <li>Progression is subjective.</li>
    <li>FW to decide on increases:
    <ol>
      <li>Fix anyone underpaid according to market rate or their peers.</li>
      <li>Increase anyone promote to a new role.</li>
      <li>Inflation.</li>
      <li>Increase pay in line with performance.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-16"></a>Chapter 16 - The Modern Workplace</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We all have an implicit bias.</li>
  <li>Call out incorrect behaviour.</li>
  <li>Remote working:
  <ul>
    <li>Work in the open.</li>
    <li>Document though processes.</li>
    <li>Write up decisions, priorities and actions.</li>
    <li>Encourage all staff to take complete ownership of unblocking themselves.</li>
    <li>Have multiple items to work on.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Leave loudly.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-17"></a>Chapter 17 - Startups</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First manager == VP engineering
  <ul>
    <li>Ownership delivery process.</li>
    <li>Performance of engineers.</li>
    <li>Resource and prioritization of projects.</li>
    <li>Hiring.</li>
    <li>Building stuff.</li>
    <li>Keep CTO focused on building.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Are you a cathedral builder or a bazaar browser?</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-18"></a>Chapter 18 - The Crystal Ball</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes having fewer options work out better.</li>
  <li>Every job that you have should be a meaningful step towards the vision that you have for yourself in the future.</li>
  <li>People struggle to create a vision because:
  <ol>
    <li>They don’t dream big enough.</li>
    <li>They aren’t clear enough.</li>
  </ol></li>
