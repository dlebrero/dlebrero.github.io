  </ul></li>
  <li>Optionality:

    <li>The future is uncertain and inherently unpredictable.</li>
    <li>Optionality can be preserved at low cost.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The most important aspect of API-enabled digital treasure hunting: you don’t need a map.</li>
  <li>API allow them to be used in many unanticipated ways.</li>
  <li>Treasure-Hunting methods:
  <ol>
    <li>Create optionality through unbundling:
    <ul>
      <li>Spend less time trying to predict the future and more preparing for any eventuality.</li>
      <li>API: unbundle business capabilities into digital assets that can be combined and composed into new products, processes, and experiences that meet opportunities unlocked by innovation.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Identify opportunities through value dynamics:
    <ul>
      <li>Value exchange by powering B2B.</li>
      <li>Value dynamics is a visual method of designing business models through value network and API-enabled value exchange.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Optimize value through feedback loops:
    <ul>
      <li>Use APIs to collect feedback on business activity that can guide digital strategy.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>4 winning strategies:
  <ol>
    <li>Exchange optimization: adapt to the digital world, thus increasing speed and scale of value exchanges while lowering coordination costs.</li>
    <li>Distributed innovation: Innovation in the hands of business users.</li>
    <li>Capability capitalization: unbundle and rebundle business capabilities to create new products.</li>
    <li>Value aggregation: connect disparate value networks.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>This is a book about connection:
  <ul>
    <li>Business to technology.</li>
    <li>Long-term strategy to short term return on investment.</li>
    <li>Intuition to science.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="p-1"></a>Part 1 - Innovation By Accident</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“Happy accidents” occur too frequently to be dismissed as coincidences.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-1"></a>Chapter 1 - Treasure in Transformation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Whereas a product strategy is about trying to anticipate market and user needs and then delivering packaged products to meet those needs, a platform strategy is about giving the right tools to developers to test their own ideas and build their own products and services.</li>
  <li>The Golden Rule of Platform is that you “Eat Your Own Dog-food”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://nordicapis.com/the-bezos-api-mandate-amazons-manifesto-for-externalization/">Bezos API Mandate</a>.</li>
  <li>O’Reilly listed four reasons Amazon needed to adopt a platform culture by unbundling their capabilities through APIs:
  <ul>
    <li>APIs would provide a gateway for all the smart and creative people who work outside of Amazon to create unanticipated innovation for the company.</li>
    <li>New revenue opportunities for Amazon if they were willing to be patient.</li>
    <li>Web functioned like an ecosystem: The more life there is, the more there is for everyone.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Amazon “New Process Initiative” to prioritize funding for new ideas became a bottleneck:
  <ul>
    <li>They were able to unstick the process by addressing their software architecture.</li>
    <li>It took several years to address getting all the teams to have hard, well-documented APIs.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-2"></a>Chapter 2 - The Science of Happy Accidents</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We underestimate longer-term change because we fail to see that innovation happens in combination.</li>
  <li>Digital strategy:
  <ol>
    <li>Orgs should strive to have a lot of capabilities.</li>
    <li>Those capabilities need to be “combinable”.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Data is a non-rival good: it is not consumed or possessed by only one party at a time.</li>
  <li>Rival products are limited by unit costs:
  <ul>
    <li>Return is capped by logistic constraints within their market.</li>
    <li>Concave curve when plotting their costs vs returns.</li>
    <li>Non-rival goods are the opposite.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>In digital products, the degree of convexity is driven by the cost of experimentation.</li>
  <li><code>OOOps</code>:
  <ul>
    <li>Create <strong>O</strong>ptionality through unbundled APIs.</li>
    <li>Identify <strong>O</strong>pportunities through value dynamics.</li>
    <li>Drive <strong>O</strong>ptimization through feedback loops.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Slowing down the process of making commitments conserves optionality.</li>
  <li>Business Model Canvas defines business models as the way companies create, deliver, and capture value:
  <ul>
    <li>Value dynamics is a visual method for mapping out business models by illustrating the flow of value in a digital ecosystem:
    <ul>
      <li>Shapes to depict constituents in the ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Arrows to show the flow of value between constituents.</li>
      <li>Icons that indicate what type of value “currency” is being exchanged.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>For experimentation at scale:
  <ul>
    <li>Feature flags.</li>
    <li>Ramps: funnel a controllable percentage of all application traffic.</li>
    <li>Visualization tools.</li>
    <li>Statistical literacy and tooling:
    <ul>
      <li>Data beats math.</li>
      <li>Statistics tools can be misleading and cause speed-killing friction when you don’t have the expertise to discern what the results mean and what they don’t.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Feedback without a strategy direction would just provide a more accurate means of demonstrating stagnation.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Not a simple task to get all stakeholders aligned on the worthiness of making the investment when the outcome is undefined.
  <ul>
    <li>Finance and executive leadership are slow to recognize and support anything that can’t be expressed in a deterministic financial model.</li>
    <li>There is a need for a new lens on how to view business forecasts along with a “new math” that will drive a different approach to investment and continual transformation.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carliss_Y._Baldwin">Carliss Y. Baldwin</a>: Higher option value being present “when consumer tastes are heterogeneous or unpredictable, and technological trajectories are uncertain”.</li>

    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Wc5meM">Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</a>.</li>
    <li>Two types of options: concave and convex.</li>
    <li>Three factors of optionality:
    <ul>
      <li>Incremental cost (pain) to generate and maintain the option.</li>
      <li>Potential value (gain) that could come when you exercise the option.</li>
      <li>How the value scales when the rate of change (variable/uncertainty) scales on the Y axis.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>When:
    <ol>
      <li>The future is uncertain and inherently unpredictable.</li>
      <li>Optionality can be preserved at low cost.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Then, potential gain is staggering because uncertainty increases the upside but not the downside. <img src="/images/blog/books/unbundling-the-enterprise/concave-and-convex-option.png" alt="concave and convex options model" /></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>A large exposure to a single trial has lower expected return than a portfolio of small trials.</li>
    <li>Attempts to use human understanding as a tool to predict future events are made in vain given that the prediction of future events in the modern worlds is impossible.</li>
    <li>Abandon your sense of knowledge and instead look for systems with asymmetry between pain and gain.</li>
    <li>Serial optionality, where winning options build upon each other to attain asymmetric gains.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If you understand the futility of trying to predict the future in an uncertain world, then manufacturing and preserving convex optionality is the surest way to outperform the competition over time.</li>
  <li>The more uncertain the future, the greater the value of preserving optionality.</li>
  <li>Four rules:
  <ol>
    <li>Convexity is easier to attain than knowledge.</li>
    <li>A convexity strategy can be executed by:
    <ol>
      <li>Lowering the cost per unit of trail, and</li>
      <li>Increasing teh number of trails as large as possible.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>This minimized the probability of missing the winning option rather than maximizing the profits of a winning option.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Preserving serial optionality beats a strategic plan:
    <ul>
      <li>Long term strategic plans tend to have the side effect of restricting optionality by locking teams and systems into rigid models and policies.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Get into the habit of cataloging negative results.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Casinos don’t gamble: they provide entertainment to guests and work the math at scale.</li>
  <li>What tactics will be the most efficient and effective at lowering the costs per unit of a trial?</li>
  <li>Steps:
  <ul>
    <li>High concave:
    <ul>
      <li>Monolith apps + self-managed dedicated physical infrastructure.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Partially transformed:
    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure as a Service.</li>
      <li>Multi-variable testing.</li>
      <li>Still highly complex code that is conceptually tied to a single context of use.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Highly convex:
    <ul>
      <li>Previous step plus decoupled APIs.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Baldwin, <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/09-034_149607b7-2b95-4316-b4b6-1df66dd34e83.pdf">The Architecture of Platforms</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Controlling the interfaces to value rather than just the systems that deliver value is the better strategy.</li>
    <li>Open by default is a better strategy than closed by default.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>When you choose a popular and easy-to-understand interface, it is critical to make sure that your chosen interface won’t be too easy to commoditize or one that is easily abstracted.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-4"></a>Chapter 4 - Opportunism through Value Dynamics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Value dynamics will improve your ability to identify high-value opportunities where you can exploit the optionality.</li>
  <li>Business model as “the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers and captures value”.</li>
  <li>Value dynamics is a way of visually analyzing business models in an ecosystem context to develop strategies on how to intentionally evolve them.</li>
  <li>Key concepts:
  <ul>
    <li>Value network: bounded business ecosystem within which value flows.</li>
    <li>Constituents: orgs and groups of people defined by a role or persona.</li>
    <li>Value exchange: bidirectional flow of value between two constituents.</li>
    <li>Discrete set of value currencies: <img src="/images/blog/books/unbundling-the-enterprise/value-currencies.jpeg" alt="Set value currency" /></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Value networks are typically centered around a specific constituent. <img src="/images/blog/books/unbundling-the-enterprise/values-network-example-facebook.png" alt="Value network example" /></li>
  <li>Opening business capabilities through APIs allowed an incremental rollout that gave the companies time to learn and adjust.</li>
  <li>Six ways to use value dynamics:
  <ol>
    <li>Analyze existing business models:
    <ul>
      <li>How balanced and sustainable are?</li>
      <li>How well-differentiated are your org’s enabling capabilities?</li>
      <li>Are there additional value currencies that can be captured?</li>
      <li>Are there any constituents who are positioned to disrupt the overall ecosystem?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Define new business models:
    <ul>
      <li>Start by charting a specific customer segment.</li>
      <li>Include intermediaries.</li>
      <li>Consider supporting constituents.</li>
      <li>What do my competitor’s value network look like?</li>
      <li>Are there constituents or value exchanges missing?</li>
      <li>What do the value networks look like for orgs in similar positions in other industries?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Find new value channels:
    <ul>
      <li>Identify missing links, specially between your org and its end customer.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Augment current value exchanges:
    <ul>
      <li>All value exchanges are asymmetrical, as each constituent values the different currencies being exchanged differently.
      <ul>
        <li>So, it is quite possible that there are new currencies your org could request without constituents feeling that they are giving anything away.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Optimize supply-side exchanges:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Diversify a sole-supplier to reduce cost or risk.</li>
    <li>Are there suppliers that rise above their peers and warrant exclusivity?</li>
    <li>Any supplier that could be insourced or any capability outsourced?</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Connect value networks:
    <ul>
      <li>Connecting an org’s value networks can improve an org’s composite value proposition exponentially.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-5"></a>Chapter 5 - Optimization through Feedback Loops</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Innovation is never done.</li>
  <li>Innovation can be optimized:
  <ol>
    <li>Compress the cycle time of experiments.</li>
    <li>Execute more experiments in parallel.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>When the cost to deliver change in an org drops precipitously, a new state of “flow” will inevitably emerge within that org.</li>
  <li>As the cost to make a small change falls, so does the opportunity cost of choosing one small change over another.
  <ul>
    <li>The demand to make those changes will inevitably go up.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Focusing your resources on lowering the average cycle time of experiments within your enterprise is the most important concept in embracing optimization.</p>
  <blockquote>The only sustainable competitive advantage is an org’s ability to learn faster than the competition. <cite>Peter Senge, <a href="https://amzn.to/4cDL5Vw">The Fifth Discipline</a></cite>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p>For the optionality-based approach to work at a financial level, you need to be able to place many low-cost bets.</p></li>
  <li>You must consistently invest not only in creating the options themselves but also in cheapening the bets across the board.</li>
</ul><h1><a name="p-2"></a>Part 2 - Success Strategies</h1><h2><a name="ch-6"></a>Chapter 6 - Strategies of Success #1: Exchange Optimization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Making teams responsible for their own operational management acts as a forcing function to both keep teams honest on being efficient with their resources and to have them continually looking for ways to optimize the processes involved within their value-creating activities.</li>
  <li>Given the cost-versus-value culture in most organizations, a leader will have to chart a course to support efforts to unbundle capabilities without having a well understood path to revenue.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlrice">David Rice</a>, SVP of Product and Engineering at Cox Automotive:
  <ul>
    <li>The barrier to achieving the potential value for all the stakeholders was more grounded in financial and operating structure than in the tech stacks and application infrastructure.</li>
    <li>How do you get the business to focus on walking away from revenue in the goal of eventually getting more revenue?</li>
    <li>What is more important than your org design is the remediations you put in place to deal with the fact that the org design is suboptimal in a bunch of other cases.</li>
    <li>The path technology teams must walk is simple but not easy.
    <ul>
      <li>It requires business and cultural change, which is where the real complexities lie.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Decisions will inevitably skew to localized optimization at the expense of the whole, no matter what.</li>
    <li>Two clashing ideas that are simultaneously true:
    <ol>
      <li>The old way forces everything into a cost model.</li>
      <li>Modularity is the best hedge to “manage the unpredictability of the future”.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Time to market and future planning are opposing forces.</li>
    <li>It is easy to optimize for time to market for the first version but that is not the strategy that easily scales when successful.</li>
    <li>Position shortcuts as the exception that needs scrutiny and justification:
    <ul>
      <li>“Shortcut by default” is always adding more barriers to flexibility with every choice made.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>We want to teach teams to feel the pain of the business and the business teams to see the commons as the engine of value creation.</li>
    <li>Keep your commons teams close to the highest EBITDA revenue in order to buffer them from the unyielding waves of market volatility.
    <ul>
      <li>Place development teams as close as possible to the point of revenue.</li>
      <li>Leaders of business teams become more familiar with the value that comes out of engineering.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Key concepts for Rice’s solution:
    <ol>
      <li>All org models are flawed. Choose the model that:
      <ul>
        <li>Has problem that are irrelevant for your context, or</li>
        <li>Are the sort of problems that you are well-prepared to mitigate.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Finance respects growth above all else:
      <ul>
        <li>Stasis and growth below expectations is also treated as decline.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Jens Rasmussen and Dr. Richard Cook, <a href="https://medium.com/10x-curiosity/boundaries-of-failure-rasmussens-model-of-how-accidents-happen-58dc61eb1cf">Safe Boundary Model</a>. <img src="/images/blog/books/unbundling-the-enterprise/safe-boundary-model.png" alt="Safe boundary model" /></li>
  <li>Three different development org topologies:
  <ol>
    <li>Traditional Enterprise IT:
    <ul>
      <li>IT teams are segmented from and have a transactional relationship with business teams.</li>
      <li>Who owns “the what” vs who owns “the how”.</li>
      <li>Optimized for hierarchy with clean distinctions on roles and responsibilities.</li>
      <li>High risk of deep cutbacks.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Stream aligned:
    <ul>
      <li>Multidisciplinary teams that pull together all the required skills to design, create, and operate a value stream.</li>
      <li>Optimized for flow.</li>
      <li>Often rely on a centralized platform team.</li>
      <li>Platform team at risk.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Business centric:
    <ul>
      <li>API product teams are integrated into business contexts as far as possible.</li>
      <li>Optimized for stability when financial disruption inevitably comes:
      <ul>
        <li>Fine-tuning and reinvestment.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-7"></a>Chapter 7 - Strategies of Success #2: Distributed Innovation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>16m software developers globally vs 1 billion knowledge workers.</li>
  <li>3 ways to increase innovation:
  <ol>
    <li>Involve non-IT knowledge workers.</li>
    <li>Involve sw developers that do not work for you.</li>
    <li>Your own customers.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>The business model of using APIs to reach developers as customers created its own economy.</li>
  <li>“Legacy modernization” (shift-and-lift business to digital world) vs “functional modernization”.</li>
  <li>Coca-Cola:
  <ul>
    <li>Mindset: turning the enterprise into a platform of business capabilities.</li>
    <li>Productize business capabilities through APIs:
    <ul>
      <li>Without over-engineer the APIs for unknown consumers.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Expanded from the core outward.</li>
    <li>Big emphasis on feedback loops.</li>
    <li>Solutions had two aspects: what they delivered and what they enabled.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You’re never going to get the exact requirements to innovate.
  <ul>
    <li>To innovate, people have to work together, see and feel something tangible, then iterate on that.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Minimum Viable Extensible Product.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-8"></a>Chapter 8 - Strategies of Success #3: Capability Capitalization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most lucrative:
  <ul>
    <li>Unbundle and re-bundle capabilities.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>While luck may be evenly distributed and out of your control, the skills and capabilities to exploit that luck and make a return on it are in your control.</li>
  <li>Case studies:
  <ul>
    <li>Amazon.</li>
    <li>Flickr.</li>
    <li>Slack:
    <ul>
      <li>The evolution from product to platform is all about letting users build.</li>
      <li>APIs are forever, and changing them is very hard.</li>
      <li>Has defined a set of API design guidelines that they share and use to allow teams work quickly and independently.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Capital One.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Build vs buy:
  <ol>
    <li>Default to buy, build as the exception.</li>
    <li>If you build, consider it as an opportunity for a market-facing service to capitalize on.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-9"></a>Chapter 9 - Strategies of Success #4: Value Aggregation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use APIs as connection points between the models, use value dynamics to identify the opportunities for value network aggregation, and then adopt a “whole is greater than the sum of its parts” mentality to further optimize the landscape.</li>
  <li>The digital economy is largely a data economy.</li>
  <li>Amazon, Google, Facebook: data is what fuels and differentiates each of their business models.</li>
  <li>Data breaks many stands economic assumptions that were established in the physical goods economic paradigm.</li>
  <li>Data is:
  <ul>
    <li>Non-rival: can be consumed/held by multiple users.</li>
    <li>Non-fungible: sufficiently unique so that it cannot be substituted.</li>
    <li>Experience good:
    <ul>
      <li>Value is not know until it has been consumed.</li>
      <li>Opposite is search good, which value can be determined prior to consumption.</li>
      <li>There can be a wide variance in the perceived value depending on the consumer’s context.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Positive externalities:
    <ul>
      <li>Accumulating more data makes the data you already have more valuable.</li>
      <li>Data is the new oil: old is the exact opposite of data: a rival, fungible, search good.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Data is how disparate value networks can be connected.</li>
  <li>Case studies:
  <ul>
    <li>Google Maps.</li>
    <li>Best Buy.</li>

    <li>Two-sided marketplaces and network effects.</li>
    <li>“Inverted firm”: create platforms that capture value by intermediating value exchanges between third parties.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4968">How APIs Create Growth by Inverting the Firm</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Firms adopting public APIs grew an additional 38.7% over sixteen years relative to similar non-adopters.</li>
    <li>Relationship is causal, not just correlated.</li>
    <li>No statistically significant relationship between internal API adoption and firm performance.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Considerations for API Providers (page 167 or 195 in pdf).</li>
  <li>Firms with public APIs see significantly increased risk of hack events in the years after opening an API.</li>
  <li>Legal as a tool to be managed rather than as a constraint of business possibilities.
  <ul>
    <li>Best managed as an advisory function in the go-to-market phase rather than a gating function in the ideation and prototyping phases.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Launching external API-based offering without some form of centralized monitoring and governance capabilities is akin of running with scissors.</li>
  <li>Once you acknowledge that a specific future can’t be predicted, the basic premise of being flexible in the face of generic future changes is the commonsense choice to at least hedge your uncertainty.</li>
  <li>Most critical business metrics for a digital transformation:
  <ol>
    <li>Time to experiment: time and resources required to expose an experimental delivery of value to the external market.</li>
    <li>Time to impactful insight: time and resources to evaluate the outcome of the experiment with meaningful business implications.</li>
    <li>Time to value: time and resources required to realize revenue from an experiment.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-11"></a>Chapter 11 - Ensuring a Durable Transformation by Understanding the Risks</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Increased security risk:
  <ul>
    <li>Orgs with APIs that are widely used in external contexts have a lower frequency of breaches by malicious insiders than orgs that use exclusively internal APIs.</li>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Security by obscurity.</li>
      <li>Teams are expected to come up with an approach that works for their unique context.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Mitigation: appropriate tools and support to treat security management as non-deferrable scope.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Increased performance risk:
  <ul>
    <li>Due to more network hops.</li>
    <li>Risk of degraded performance and increase in infrastructure cost is preferred to:
    <ul>
      <li>Over-engineering for performance.</li>
      <li>Productivity loss due to monolith.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Mitigation:
    <ul>
      <li>Detailed profiling and optimization can wait, but enabling quick cycle time for isolating and solving performance issues cannot.</li>
      <li>Parity across technical environments.</li>
      <li>Quantify the value of performance.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Increased risk to quality issues:
  <ul>
    <li>More moving parts means more things to break.</li>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Overly reliant on manual testing practices.</li>
      <li>QA cycles and disciplines are segmented in a silo separated from sw dev.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Mitigation:
    <ul>
      <li>Tools that help shift left.</li>
      <li>Compress the timeline, risk, and scale of experiments.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Increased operational complexity:
  <ul>
    <li>More moving parts == more complex to operate.</li>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation is scarce.</li>
      <li>Automated onboarding tools for API consumers are not provisioned.</li>
      <li>Teams routinely engaged in unplanned work.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Mitigation:
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare early and optimize late.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Misapply the MVP concept:
  <ul>
    <li>MVP == maximum amount of validated customer feedback with minimal effort.
    <ul>
      <li>A tool for testing hypotheses and discovering what will meet customers’ needs.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Teams fail to consider that experiments must be iterative to yield useful feedback.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Cannibalizing Existing Revenue:
  <ul>
    <li>Teams must have a nuanced understanding of financial details of the existing revenue streams.</li>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Product dev team fails to evaluate how new offering would lead to revenue growth for existing offerings, or how to position it as extensions/add-ones to existing offerings.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Technology centered transformation:
  <ul>
    <li>Technology-specific objectives rather than business objectives.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Misaligned talent model and processes:
  <ul>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Over-reliance on proxy metrics and singular numbers that don’t convey context.</li>
      <li>Localized goals at the expense of enterprise goals.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Mitigations:
    <ul>
      <li>“m-shaped” profiles.</li>
      <li>Training on data visualization and statistical literacy.</li>

  <li>Losing discipline in times of compression:
  <ul>
    <li>Financial compression tactics are not aligned with preservation of value creation.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Choosing the wrong interface to control:
  <ul>
    <li>Control the interface to value rather than just the systems that deliver value is the better strategy.</li>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Your teams don’t have a process for understanding and evaluating how and when consumer value is added and harvested in your value stream.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Pervasive use of performative behaviors (aka optionality theater):
  <ul>
    <li>Performative compliance.</li>
    <li>Signs:
    <ul>
      <li>Referring to hard rules that don’t offer insight into applying them with a smart mindset.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Mitigation:

</ol><h2><a name="ch-12"></a>Chapter 12 - Embracing Uncertainty</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The proliferation of hyper-specialized offerings is poised to continue its acceleration while simultaneously making larger firms more efficient and productive.
  <ul>
    <li>APIs are at the heart.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>One potential future implication of the fall in interaction costs is that large sectors of the global economy will depend upon increasingly complex networks of decoupled providers.
  <ul>
    <li>A natural outcome is the need to increase service robustness and fault-tolerant services.</li>
    <li>May cause the emergency of a new type of provider - a meta-aggregator that manages and routes traffic to the most efficient source of fulfillment.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The semantic web:
  <ul>
    <li>Generative AI looks like the key that will unlock this capability.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>For APIs, coordination costs will drop again as APIs become self-describing once LLM agents are pointed towards them.</li>
</ul><h1><a name="ch-13"></a>Conclusion</h1>

  <li>83% of all internet traffic in 2018 is API traffic.</li>
  <li>Most valuable treasures out there are the ones you don’t yet know to look for.</li>
