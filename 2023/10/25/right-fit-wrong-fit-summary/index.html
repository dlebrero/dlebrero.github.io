					<div class="entry-content"><p>These are my notes on <a href="https://amzn.to/3QrhK7X">Wrong Fit, Right Fit: Why How We Work Matters More Than Ever</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/gramico">André Martin</a></p><p>Very interesting view on how to find your ideal job, and how companies can hire the right people: focus a lot more on how day-to-day work is done (and our preferences).</p><h1>Key Insights</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Fit: Deep and authentic connection to how a company works day-to-day.</li>
  <li>No place will be a perfect match.</li>
  <li>Working harder to fit in does not produce right fit; rather the opposite.</li>
  <li>Who a company says they are rarely matches how that company works day-to-day.</li>
  <li>Talent is “forced” to bump into ill-defined ways of working, use their creative energy to understand how things actually get done.</li>
  <li>Begin sharing the choice you are planning to make. If feel hesitation, doubt, or anxiety as you share there is likely something not lining up.</li>
  <li>Top 20% talent produce 80% of value.</li>
  <li>What if interviews where less like first dates and more like family reunions?</li>
  <li><a href="#ch-4">Chapter 4</a> is gold to understand yourself. Holistic Candidate Profile:
  <ol>
    <li>What are my core values?</li>
    <li>What is the life I am building?</li>
    <li>What is my craft/superpower?</li>
    <li>Who is my ideal leader?</li>
    <li>How do I like to work?</li>
    <li>What am I solving for?</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>When a product appears superior on aspects that are comparable with other products, we will fill in the gaps on missing information or difficult to ascertain attributes in a manner that supports that superiority.</li>
  <li>As an interviewee, “How can I position myself as the best candidate for the job?”
  <ul>
    <li>We end up “acting” versus “being”.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Most variance in satisfaction of an employee can be accounted for by their manager or leader.</li>
  <li><a href="#questions">Questions to understand ways of working in the company</a>:
  <ol>
    <li>What is the profile of the person who succeeds here?</li>
    <li>What is the reputation of the function/team you are joining?</li>
    <li>What happens here that didn’t happen at the other companies you worked at previously?</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>New talent is highly impressionable. Make sure they are surrounded by the “models of your culture” early and often.</li>
  <li>Onboarding:
  <ul>
    <li>Keep a journal.</li>
    <li>90 days.</li>
    <li>To figure out if it is right fit.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="#howwork">How does the company get work done?</a>
  <ol>
    <li>How does the company collaborate?
    <ul>
      <li>Most fundamental attribute of right fit.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How company assess performance?
    <ul>
      <li>Companies pay for one of:
      <ol>
        <li>Performance.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated expertise.</li>
        <li>Lived values/behaviours.</li>
        <li>Long-term commitment.</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Who owns my career, the company or me?</li>
  <li>Our education has trained us to ignore all the positives and go straight to the places to improve.</li>
  <li>As an executive leader, how you decide to work sets the floor (minimum expectation), not the ceiling.</li>
  <li>The Fit Assessment (page 126).</li>
  <li>The later you marry, the less likely you are to divorce.</li>
  <li>Learning improves self-confidence, curb anxiety and depression.</li>
  <li>Companies that promote learning regularly outperform competitors.</li>
  <li>Try to create a week calendar that is closer to your ideal in terms of time, types of meeting, and people you work alongside.</li>
  <li>A team makes the manager, not the other way around.</li>
  <li>Individual feedback have an inverse relationship to seniority. (Should be the opposite!).</li>
  <li>If you don’t say no, then your yes is meaningless.</li>
  <li>Culture is an outcome.</li>
  <li>With each new recruit, it gets harder to consistently teach or develop consistent unwritten practices.</li>
  <li>To know how to the company should work in the future, study the company’s most productive teams of today:
  <ul>
    <li>Somewhere out in your company, there is a better practice for everything.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="#realistic-job-preview">Realistic job preview</a>.</li>
  <li>Team membership is as much of an art as team leadership.</li>
  <li>Transition from one role to another:
  <ul>
    <li>Companies usually ask to cover for both roles:
    <ul>
      <li>More stress in an already stressful situation.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Instead:
    <ul>
      <li>7 days off to rest.</li>
      <li>7 days for reflection, reconnection and reset.</li>
    </ul></li>

</ul><h1><a name="p-0"></a>Introduction: There is a Right Fit Company Waiting for You</h1>
<ul>
  <li>What if it isn’t about changing how we work, but rather improving our chances of creating and finding a better fit?</li>
  <li>Book based on 65 in-depth interviews, all level and different company sizes.</li>
  <li>Fit:
  <ul>
    <li>Deep and authentic connection to how a company works day-to-day.</li>
    <li>Days feel easy, work is meaningful and connection with company grows exponentially.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Ways of working is innate in the fabric of the company and often emanate from early days:
  <ul>
    <li>How prioritize work, solve problems, innovate, manage conflict, socialize projects.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Way of working often undervalued during recruitment.</li>
  <li>Pressure during interview to “fit in”.</li>
  <li>Three key misalignments:
  <ol>
    <li>Total mismatch: “Nobody at the company looks like me or works like me”.</li>
    <li>Person mismatch: “Nobody at the company looks like me, but many people work how I prefer to work”.</li>
    <li>Way of working mismatch: “People look like me but nobody works the way I prefer to work”.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h1><a name="p-1"></a>Part 1: Context + Right Fit</h1><h2><a name="ch-1"></a>Chapter 1: How the Workplace Has Changed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Great Resignation:
  <ul>
    <li>2022, 77% of talent resigns within the first three years. 45% within one year.</li>
    <li>Survey: Of 2000 US employees with less than 6 month at the company, 50% are actively looking for something new.</li>
    <li>2020:
    <ul>
      <li>PwC estimated 65% employees are looking for a new job.</li>
      <li>Gallup estimated $7.8 trillion of productivity loss due to disengaged employees.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>As human being, we want to be part of a community and be committed to something bigger than ourselves.</li>
  <li>Trends:
  <ol>
    <li>Rise of the culture deck:
    <ul>
      <li>Netflix started it.</li>
      <li>Brand campaigns made culture aspirational and the day-to-day climate less and less of a priority.</li>
      <li>More adept to talking about culture than doing.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The Ping-Pong table of purposeless perks:
    <ul>
      <li>Clarity about what actually matters was being clouded by more and more stuff.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The decade of decedent growth:
    <ul>
      <li>2009 to 2020 marked the longest economic expansion in the last 80 years.</li>
      <li>Habits are formed that don’t help in tougher times.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>A crisis of commitment:
    <ul>
      <li>With the abundance that surrounds us, we have entered into a constant state of infinite browsing where we strive to “keep our options open” over “the option to choose to dedicate ourselves to”.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The side hustle economy:
    <ul>
      <li>46% americans took on a side hustle to cover their monthly budget.</li>
      <li>Formal employers are getting the rest of us, not the best of us.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Being more vs doing more:
    <ul>
      <li>Does what I am doing matter?</li>
      <li>2017 study: found that 41% of a typical knowledge worker task don’t add value.</li>
      <li>Not simply doing less, but better connect all the things we do to a higher purpose.</li>
      <li>When we are inspired, we have a nearly insatiable energy to create.</li>
      <li>Proximity can accelerate work.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>If you’re talent, maybe it’s time to start searching for a place you can love day-to-day in balance with searching for a position you can do or a brand you revere.</li>
  <li>If you’re a leader, create an experience that fits those who “love what we love” as opposed to either allowing many cultures under one umbrella or trying to create a place where everyone can be, on average, not unhappy.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-2"></a>Chapter 2 - Why Right Fit Is So Rare</h2>
<ul>
  <li>World Health Organization definition of burnout: a syndrome resulting from workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.
  <ul>
    <li>Three dimensions:
    <ul>
      <li>Feeling of energy depletion.</li>
      <li>Increased mental distance or negative feeling about one’s job.</li>
      <li>Reduced professional efficacy.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Cost of labor is typically 70% of operating budget.</li>
  <li>Cognitive dissonance:
  <ul>
    <li>Discomfort of making a choice or acting in a manner that is incongruent with one’s stated values, opinions or preferences.</li>
    <li>Begin sharing the choice you are planning to make. If feel hesitation, doubt, or anxiety as you share there is likely something not lining up.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Approach and Avoidance Systems:
  <ul>
    <li>Avoidance system: stop us from doing thing that put us in danger.</li>
    <li>Approach system:
    <ul>
      <li>Pleasure-based desires.</li>
      <li>Pleasure now and pain later.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>When choosing a job, approach system can overtake the avoidance system.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>BIRG-ing and Fit:
  <ul>
    <li>BIRG-ing:
    <ul>
      <li>Basking in reflected glory.</li>
      <li>Using others’ success to boost our own self-image.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>CORF-ing:
    <ul>
      <li>Cutting off reflected failure.</li>
      <li>Distance ourselves from failure.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Football: we won vs they lost.</li>
    <li>Choosing a job for BIRG-ing.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Fit is not about fitting in.
  <ul>
    <li>In wrong fit, we end up using our creative energy to “fit in”.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Do I fit here?</li>
</ul><p><img src="/images/blog/books/wrong-fit-right-fit/do-i-fit-here.jpeg" alt="Do I fit here?" /></p><h1><a name="p-2"></a>Part 2 - Talent + Right Fit</h1><h2><a name="ch-3"></a>Chapter 3 - Beginning the Search for Right Fit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers were able to prove that there is no standard bell curve when it comes to performance.
  <ul>
    <li>Top 20% talent produce 80% of value.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>82% of Fortune 500 executive said they do not recruit highly talented people. 93% don’t believe they develop people fast and effectively.</li>
  <li>What if interviews where less like first dates and more like family reunions?</li>
  <li>Holistic Candidate Profile:
  <ol>
    <li>What are my core values?</li>
    <li>What is the life I am building?</li>
    <li>What is my craft/superpower?</li>
    <li>Who is my ideal leader?</li>
    <li>How do I like to work?</li>
    <li>What am I solving for?</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Realistic Experience Preview:
  <ol>
    <li>What are our lived values?</li>
    <li>What promise do we make to talent?</li>
    <li>How do we make money/have an impact?</li>
    <li>What is the profile of your leader?</li>
    <li>What is the job the next 12-18 months?</li>
    <li>What are the principles, practices, and platforms that define how work gets done?</li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-4"></a>Chapter 4 - Self-Reflection and Fit Excursions</h2><p>For talent, 8 core question. This chapter contains one “Excursion”/exercise to help you answer them.</p>
<ol>
  <li>What are the values you most consistently hold?
  <ul>
    <li>Pick from pairs of values.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>What is the life you are trying to build?
  <ul>
    <li>In two years time, what if:
    <ul>
      <li>Nothing changed.</li>
      <li>Dream the dream.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>What are your superpowers? What are you best at (vs what do you love to do)?
  <ul>
    <li>Superpowers:
    <ul>
      <li>What gaps do you fill in every company you have joined?</li>
      <li>What areas of expertise are you attempting to hone?</li>
      <li>What do people come to you for?</li>
      <li>What activities do you volunteer to take?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Shadow side:
    <ul>
      <li>Often from overused strengths or non-productive behaviours when under stress.</li>
      <li>When under stress for long period, we flip into “the grip” <a href="https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/what-youre-like-during-grip-stress-based-on-your-myers-briggs-personality-type/">(Myers Briggs)</a>: unfamiliar and unproductive version of ourselves.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Are you of craft, company or cause?</li>
  <li>Who is your ideal leader? What do you need from them to succeed?
  <ul>
    <li>Good chemistry with a manager is so important and so rare that many successful talent and leadership experts advocate for following a great manager.</li>
    <li>Things that we look for in our managers, will be gifted at ourselves.</li>
    <li>We gain our skills as managers from our managers.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If you were to start a company, what would you do? How would you want it to feel?</li>
  <li>Above all else, what matters most to you right now? What are you solving for?
  <ul>
    <li>Our careers can be central to our life in some moments, and they can be enablers of our life in others.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>How to you bring all of your answers together into a single leadership story?
  <ul>
    <li>At the heart of finding right fit is changing the frame of how you see yourself.</li>

</ol><h1><a name="p-3"></a>Part 3 - Interviewing and Onboarding + Right Fit</h1><h2><a name="ch-5"></a>Chapter 5 - Don’t Judge a Company by Its Career Page</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning">Motivated reasoning</a>: When the early signals we get about a product or a place are positive and hold true, we will likely stop our search for new information or comparisons to other options.</li>
  <li>When a product appears superior on aspects that are comparable with other products, we will fill in the gaps on missing information or difficult to ascertain attributes in a manner that supports that superiority.</li>
  <li>Confirmation bias: potentially confirmatory evidence tends to be taken at face value while potentially dis-confirmatory evidence is subjected to critical and skeptical scrutiny.</li>
  <li>Information available about a company is “mostly true version of the truth”:
  <ul>
    <li>Doesn’t give enough information to really see the cracks that every company has.</li>
    <li>Employer-brand version of Snapchat filters.</li>
    <li>Most sources are internally produced and relatively subjective.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Rules to validate information:
  <ol>
    <li>More than three sources.</li>
    <li>Internal and external materials.</li>
    <li>Subjective and objective data.</li>
    <li>If something feels off, dive deeper. Don’t ignore it.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>As an interviewee:
  <ul>
    <li>“How can I position myself as the best candidate for the job?”
    <ul>
      <li>The very nature of the question can lead us astray.</li>
      <li>We end up “acting” versus “being”.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a name="questions"></a>Questions to understand ways of working in the company:
  <ol>
    <li>What is the profile of the person who succeeds here?
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how the company defines success.</li>
      <li>Ask interviewer to tell you about a real person.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the company get work done? (chapter 6)</li>
    <li>What is the company’s relationship to time?

      <li>Most important.</li>
      <li>Productivity equals full calendar?</li>
      <li>Is unlimited vacation really unlimited?</li>
      <li>Do you need to be at the office or in a meeting to be deemed productive?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>What is the reputation of the function/team you are joining?</li>
    <li>What are your day-to-day duties?
    <ul>
      <li>What will be the first three deliverables be once onboarding is complete?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the leader get productivity out of their team?
    <ul>
      <li>Most variance in satisfaction of an employee can be accounted for by their manager or leader.</li>
      <li>Study by Artz et al. found that technical competence mattered above else.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Where do people go once they leave this job/team/leader?

      <li>Most underrated skill as a leader is being a “star maker”.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>What happens here that didn’t happen at the other companies you worked at previously?
    <ul>
      <li>Whether the culture has been solidified enough to turn into longstanding and unique practices.</li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-6"></a>Chapter 6 - Figuring Out If You Really Fit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To find right fit, you should spend your first ninety days focused on understanding the reality of how the company truly works day-to-day and assessing that against your preferences.</li>
  <li>New talent is highly impressionable. Make sure they are surrounded by the “models of your culture” early and often.</li>
  <li>Fitting in is shifting away from your natural preference to be included or feel sense of belonging. This is a normal reaction to starting a new job.</li>
  <li>Most companies rarely fully understand or know how to articulate how work actually gets done.</li>
  <li>Three versions of a company:
  <ol>
    <li>The company we would be if we were at our best:
    <ul>
      <li>Recruiter version to sell the position.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>What is shown to talent on their first day:
    <ul>
      <li>Akin to being toured through a museum.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How it is for most people, every day.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>As talent, onboarding:
  <ul>
    <li>Is about determining right or wrong fit.</li>
    <li>Rules:
    <ol>
      <li>Avoid snap judgments: take the full 90 days.</li>
      <li>Keep a journal.</li>
      <li>Review what you have learned at day 10, 30, 60 and 90:
      <ul>
        <li>Patterns and themes.</li>
        <li>Share with your manager/mentor.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Let the facts lead you to your conclusions, not the other way around.</li>
      <li>Focus your assessment on the ways the company works.</li>
      <li>Make a decision to commit, or not:
      <ul>
        <li>Most important and difficult without a framework.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Create buffers to sustain right fit as the company grows/transforms.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a name="howwork"></a>How does the company get work done?
  <ol>
    <li>How does the company make decisions?
    <ul>
      <li>Tradeoffs made. Is everything a priority?</li>
      <li>Is there a clearly defined strategy that people can make decisions in alignment with?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the company solve problems?
    <ul>
      <li>What information is most valuable when determining the best solution?</li>
      <li>Best companies use approach depending on the size and complexity or company values.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How are ideas communicated?
    <ul>
      <li>Full sentences or pithy one-liners?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the company collaborate?
    <ul>
      <li>Most fundamental attribute of right fit.</li>
      <li>Area that diverges the most from team to team.</li>
      <li>Pay attention to:
      <ul>
        <li>Meeting culture.</li>
        <li>Primary tools used to communicate.</li>
        <li>Cadence of work.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How company assess performance?
    <ul>
      <li>Output, outcomes, strength of relationships, time in your seat or billed hours?</li>
      <li>Companies pay for one of:
      <ol>
        <li>Performance.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated expertise.</li>
        <li>Lived values/behaviours.</li>
        <li>Long-term commitment.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>To understand your own beliefs, look back at the classes you most enjoyed in school:
      <ul>
        <li>How did you get graded?</li>
        <li>Work alone or in groups?</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the company provide feedback?
    <ul>
      <li>Open, honest and consistent feedback is a rarity.</li>
      <li>We are fairly self-centered and idiosyncratic in our measurements, and thus our assessment is ultimately random and potentially damaging.</li>
      <li>Our education has trained us to ignore all the positives and go straight to the places to improve.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the company resolve conflict and break ties?
    <ul>
      <li>Are purpose, values or principles used?</li>
      <li>Full commitment or “disagree and commit”?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How company develops its talent?
    <ul>
      <li>Turning key events into lessons takes self-awareness, feedback, coaching, learning and testing out new behaviours, things that most companies fail to invest in.</li>
      <li>Who owns my career, the company or me?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does information flow?
    <ul>
      <li>Tells where decisions get made.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the company socialize/gather?
    <ul>
      <li>What does the company celebrate?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>What is the company’s relationship with time?
    <ul>
      <li>When on vacation, are I still available or unreachable?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How does the company view rest and recovery?
    <ul>
      <li>Do leaders take vacation quietly, or are they vocal about taking breaks?</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>No place will be a perfect match.</li>
  <li>As an executive leader, how you decide to work sets the floor (minimum expectation), not the ceiling.</li>
  <li>The Fit Assessment (page 126).</li>
</ul><h1><a name="p-4"></a>Part 4 - Buffers + Right Fit</h1><h2><a name="ch-7"></a>Chapter 7 - Inspirational Buffers and Enhancing Fit Over Time</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Great fit now doesn’t guarantee that it will remain that way.</li>
  <li>Wrong fit is rarely sustainable for an extended period.</li>
  <li>Buffers to fit:
  <ul>
    <li>Actions to improve the overall experience over time.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Two categories:
  <ol>
    <li>Inspirational:
    <ul>
      <li>Those that connect us to something more meaningful.</li>
      <li>Increase better and more value-adding work.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Relational: center around people who we interact with.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>The later you marry, the less likely you are to divorce.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hbr.org/2013/04/does-money-really-affect-motiv">Correlation of pay to satisfaction is very weak</a>.</li>
  <li>Intrinsic motivations FTW!</li>
  <li>Inspirational buffers:
  <ol>
    <li>Connect to Purpose or Cause:
    <ul>
      <li>Company: why is the world better with us in it?</li>
      <li>Try to connect to the company purpose at least once a week.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Increase Meaningful Work, Decrease Busy Work:
    <ul>
      <li>Two ways:
      <ol>
        <li>Align nature of work:
        <ul>
          <li>To your passions.</li>
          <li>Learn new skills.</li>
          <li>Connect to a cause you care.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Spend more time in high-value activities.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Once people know you are passionate in something, they will give you plenty of opportunity to do it.</li>
      <li>Say “no” more. Volunteer more.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>If you are learning and growing:
    <ul>
      <li>Learning improves self-confidence, curb anxiety and depression.</li>
      <li>Companies that promote learning regularly outperform competitors.</li>
      <li>Five clusters of learning opportunities:
      <ol>
        <li>Challenging assignments.</li>
        <li>Developmental relationships (mentors, teachers, managers).</li>
        <li>Hardships or adverse situations (wrong fit).</li>
        <li>Coursework and training.</li>
        <li>Personal experiences (birth of child, living in a new country).</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Majority of learning come from 1 and 2. Least from 4.</li>
      <li>Learning takes work: reflection, making connections to previous events, practicing new behaviours.</li>
      <li>Diversity of experience matters.</li>
      <li>Hardship often brings out the most raw version of ourselves.</li>
      <li>Treat every day as a prototype (== small experiment).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Find a consumer in need that you can relate to and can help.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>In any project, ask if the consumer would pay an extra 5% for the work.</li>
  <li>Make better use of your time: 41% activities are neither personally fulfilling nor add value.</li>
  <li>Procrastination:
  <ul>
    <li>More during stress.</li>
    <li>Losing time on the tasks at had due to our urgent need to “manage negative emotions”.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Working harder to fit in does not produce right fit; rather the opposite.</li>
  <li>Try to create a week calendar that is closer to your ideal in terms of time, types of meeting, and people you work alongside.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-8"></a>Chapter 8 - Relational Buffers and Enhancing Fit Over Time</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 Buffers:
  <ol>
    <li>A supportive leader/manager:
    <ul>
      <li>Look at how you can shape your manager to the one that you need.</li>
      <li>A team makes the manager, not the other way around.</li>
      <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
      <li>Individual feedback have an inverse relationship to seniority.
      <ul>
        <li>It should be the opposite as the stakes are higher!</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Managers understand if their teams are performing, but they know very little about the why.</li>
      <li>Researcher found that managers estimate their impact way higher than their reporters.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Meaningful mentor:
    <ul>
      <li>70% of talent who have a mentor are satisfied with their jobs.</li>
      <li>Mentors create connections, and connections are the seeds of commitment.</li>
      <li>3 types:
      <ol>
        <li>Storytellers: those who have been in the company for many years.</li>
        <li>Models: bleed the mission and values of the company.</li>
        <li>Masters of craft.
        <ul>
          <li>Rarely in the top leadership positions, very rarely used as mentors.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Think what are you looking for in a mentor (career advise, connections, …)</li>
      <li>Agenda should be question based and focused on real areas where you are struggling or looking for wisdom.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Workplace BFF or Doppelganger:
    <ul>
      <li>Good social relationships are one of the most consistent predictors of a happy life.</li>
      <li>Doppelganger:
      <ul>
        <li>Somebody like you but that moves through the org with greater ease.</li>
        <li>Represent future possibilities.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Invest your time in the relationship.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Life outside work is magic:
    <ul>
      <li>If you don’t say no, then your yes is meaningless. Peter Block.</li>
      <li>The happier we are at home, the more engaged and committed we will be at work.</li>
      <li>Don’t let your outside work hours be filled with sensory pursuits.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h1><a name="p-5"></a>Part 5 - Company + Right Fit</h1><h2><a name="ch-9"></a>Chapter 9 - Crafting and Communicating How the Company Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Employee experience:
  <ul>
    <li>All the touch points an employee has with the company in a single year:</li>
    <li>Physical, human, digital and administrative.</li>
    <li>Excludes “culture”. Culture is an outcome.</li>
    <li>3 elements:
    <ol>
      <li>Work principles:
      <ul>
        <li>How it should feel to work in a team.</li>
        <li>What differentiates the company.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Work practices: chapter 4.</li>
      <li>Work platforms: the technology used to do work.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>With each new recruit, it gets harder to consistently teach or develop consistent unwritten practices.</li>
  <li>Creating <em>Right Fit</em> doesn’t mean being the right place for everyone.</li>
  <li>To know how to the company should work in the future, study the company’s most productive teams of today:
  <ul>
    <li>Make consistent what has already been innovated on.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Research: people make judgements within a fraction of a second upon seeing a person’s face.</li>
  <li>Balance first impression is key: both who the company is today and what want to be tomorrow.</li>
  <li>Tips:
  <ol>
    <li>Make values the ground and work principles/practices/platforms the figure.</li>
    <li>Purpose and how it makes money overt.</li>
    <li>Show the real company in real ways.</li>
    <li>Create a network.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li><a name="realistic-job-preview"></a>Realistic job preview:
  <ol>
    <li>Nonnegotiables: set the base at a certain level.</li>
    <li>What we do:
    <ul>
      <li>How the product/service flows through the system.</li>
      <li>Focus on how the role adds value.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>How we work:
    <ul>
      <li>Be super clear about how work gets done.</li>
      <li>Prose-based work principles, practices and platforms.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>What capabilities we need.</li>
    <li>The three top deliverables for this position or this team:
    <ul>
      <li>In the next eighteen to twenty-four months.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-10"></a>Chapter 10 - Reimagining Fit - Recruiting and (Re)recruiting for Right Fit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Onboarding:
  <ul>
    <li>A company will never have a more excited or engaged employee than the moment they walk into their first day.</li>
    <li>If a company just focuses on the new joiners, their culture will transform automatically over the next few years:
    <ul>
      <li>Turnover + growth.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Anything the company spends on onboarding will be far less expensive than the hidden cost of losing new employees within their first six months.</li>
    <li>Cultural immersion: what is expected, what is valued and how works get done.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Your early network will dictate much of your long-term success.</li>
  <li>Great managers are rare:
  <ul>
    <li>Gallup: companies fail to choose the right candidate 82% of time.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Team membership is as much of an art as team leadership:
  <ul>
    <li>Teach our teams “teaming”.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Performance as the collective act by individuals dedicated to a single mission:
  <ul>
    <li>Have one strategy:
    <ul>
      <li>Teams/individuals simply need to know their place in the strategy.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Outcomes, not activities.</li>
    <li>1-2-1 focus on ensuring everyone is growing faster than the company:
    <ul>
      <li>Moving key events to lessons of experience.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Pay well and distribute bonuses to the team.</li>
    <li>Find and celebrate the “better practice”:
    <ul>
      <li>Somewhere out in your company, there is a better practice for everything.</li>
      <li>Positive disobedient.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Ensure strategy is participated in, not just developed:
  <ul>
    <li>The life or death of strategy is determined in the number of day-to-day decisions that are made in service of it (or not).</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Unnecessary meetings:
  <ul>
    <li>Those that don’t directly connect to purpose, how we work or sense of community.</li>
    <li>Asses the monetary cost of every meeting.</li>
    <li>Clear outcomes for each meeting.
    <ul>
      <li>What cannot be done in another way?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Set a limit for the size of meeting.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Transition from one role to another:
  <ul>
    <li>Companies usually ask to cover for both roles:
    <ul>
      <li>More stress in an already stressful situation.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Instead:
    <ul>
      <li>7 days off to rest.</li>
      <li>7 days for reflection, reconnection and reset.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>In times of transformation, think about how you work before you launch and design how it will work after.</li>
