<ul>
  <li>Root cause of failed product efforts: Waterfall process from ideas to deploy.
  <ul>
    <li>Causes:
    <ul>
      <li>Source of new product ideas: sales or stakeholders.</li>
      <li>Assuming you can guess the cost and benefit.</li>
      <li>Getting excited about product roadmaps:
      <ul>
        <li>Truth:
        <ul>
          <li>Half to 3/4 of ideas are not going to work.</li>
          <li>It takes several iterations for an idea to deliver the business value.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>PM, design, engineering, agile, and customer validation come in late in the game.</li>
      <li>Project centric (== outputs).</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Principles:
  <ol>
    <li>Risk tackled up front.
    <ul>
      <li>Product discovery: output is validated product backlog:
      <ul>
        <li>Will the user buy this? Value risk.</li>
        <li>Can the user figure out how to use it? UX risk.</li>
        <li>Can engineers built it? Feasibility risk.</li>
        <li>Can stakeholders support it? Business viability risk.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Products are defined and designed collaboratively.</li>
    <li>Solve problems, not implement features.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>10-20 experiments per week.</li>
  <li>MVP: minimum viable <strong>prototype</strong>.</li>
  <li>Cross-functional long-lived teams.</li>
  <li>Missionaries, not mercenaries.</li>
  <li>The Product Manager:
  <ul>
    <li>Responsible and accountable for the success of the product.</li>
    <li>Decide what gets built.</li>
    <li>Not a 9-5 job.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Ensure senior engineers are participating and contributing to product discovery.</li>
  <li>Typical roadmaps are the root cause of most waste and failed efforts in product organizations.
  <ul>
    <li>We need to solve the underlying problem, not deliver a feature.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Outcome-based roadmaps (objective list) are good, as long as not all items have a deadline.</li>
  <li>High-integrity commitments:
  <ul>
    <li>Make commitment once value, UX, feasibility and business viability are clear.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Product vision must inspire, product strategy must focus.</li>
  <li><a href="#ch-25">Principles of Product Vision</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Fall in love with the problem, not with the solution.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to disrupt yourselves because if you don&rsquo;t, someone else will.</li>
    <li>Be stubborn on vision but flexible on the details.</li>
    <li>Realize that any product vision is a leap of faith:
    <ul>
      <li>If you could truly validate a vision, then your vision is not ambitious enough.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="#ch-26">Principles of Product Strategy</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Focus on one target market or person at a time:
    <ul>
      <li>Product will likely be useful to others, but at least will be loved by some, and that&rsquo;s key.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Obsess over customers, not over competitors.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If you are a PM and not good at evangelism, there is a strong chance that your product efforts will get derailed before they see the light of the day.</li>
  <li>Most product teams have a better understanding on how to accomplish quality, rather than speed.</li>
  <li>Key to effective product discovery is getting access to our customers without pushing quick experiments into production.</li>
  <li>Customer (and executives or stakeholders) cannot tell us what they want, because:
  <ol>
    <li>They don&rsquo;t know what is possible.</li>
    <li>Nobody knows what they want until they see it.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>UX is harder and more critical than engineering.</li>
  <li>Product discovery and validation only when there is significant risk.</li>
  <li>Customer discovery program:
  <ul>
    <li>Favourite leading indicator of future success.</li>
    <li>Aim for 6 reference customers:
    <ul>
      <li>Desperate for a solution, or a technologist.</li>
      <li>Willing to spend time with product team and testing prototypes.</li>
      <li>Not building features for all reference customers, but a single solution that works for all of them.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>If you cannot recruit even 4 or 5, you are probably chasing the wrong problem.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Opportunity Assessment Technique, answer:
  <ol>
    <li>What business objective is this work intended to address? (Objective - Should match an OKR).</li>
    <li>How will you know if you&rsquo;ve succeeded? (Key result - Should match an OKR).</li>
    <li>What problem will this solve for our customers? (Customer problem).</li>
    <li>What type of customer are we focused on? (Target market).</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>It is responsibility of the PM to answer these questions.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jpattonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/story_mapping.pdf">Jeff Patton&rsquo;s Story Map Summary</a>.</li>
  <li>Customer interviews:
  <ul>
    <li>Mindset: understand and learn. Not prove.</li>
    <li>At least 2-3 hours per week.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Prototypes: can serve as a spec on what to build.</li>
  <li>Testing Usability:
  <ul>
    <li>Objective: trying to figure out how your user thinks about the problem.</li>
    <li>Avoid leading. Act like a parrot.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Qualitative Value Testing Techniques:</li>
  <li>The single most important discovery activity.</li>
  <li>User willing to pay with money, reputation or time.</li>
  <li>Head of product to highlight big learnings at all-hands. Not more than 30 mins.</li>
  <li>Only a few companies are strong both at innovation and execution.</li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-28"></a>Chapter 28: The OKR Technique</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Two fundamental principles:
  <ol>
    <li>Tell people what to do, not how.</li>
    <li>Measure by result.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>OKR = Objectives and Key Results:
  <ul>
    <li>Management + focus + alignment.</li>
    <li>Objectives qualitative.</li>
    <li>Results quantitative. Outcomes.</li>
    <li>Typical cadence: org yearly, team quarterly.</li>
    <li>1-3 objectives, 1-3 key results.</li>
    <li>Track weekly.</li>
    <li>Team accountable.</li>
    <li>Org-wide consistent evaluation/scoring.</li>
    <li>Be transparent.</li>
    <li>High-integrity commitments are binary.</li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-30"></a>Chapter 30: Product Objectives @ Scale</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Large burden on leadership and management to ensure that the org is truly aligned, that each and every product team understands how they fit into the mix, and what they are there to contribute.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-31"></a>Chapter 31: Product Evangelism</h2>

</ul><h1><a name="part-IV"></a>Part IV: The Right Process</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Product discovery:
  <ul>
    <li>Single solution that works for many customers, and not a series of specials.</li>
    <li>Learn fast + release with confidence (speed vs quality).</li>
    <li>In this book product == production ready.</li>
    <li>Most product teams have a better understanding on how to accomplish quality, rather than speed.</li>
    <li>Key to effective product discovery is getting access to our customers without pushing quick experiments into production.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-33"></a>Chapter 33: Principles of Product Discovery</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Customer (and executives or stakeholders) cannot tell us what they want, because:
  <ol>
    <li>They don&rsquo;t know what is possible.</li>
    <li>Nobody knows what they want until they see it.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Most important thing is to establish compelling value.</li>
  <li>UX is harder and more critical than engineering.</li>
  <li>Functionality, design and technology are intertwined.</li>
  <li>Many ideas won&rsquo;t work, and the ones that do require several iterations.</li>
  <li>We must validate our ideas on real users and customers.</li>
  <li>Aim to validate ideas the fastest, cheapest way possible.</li>
  <li>Shared learning by the whole team.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Aim for 10-20 iterations per week.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-34"></a>Chapter 34: Discovery Techniques Overview</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery framing techniques:
  <ul>
    <li>To quickly identify the underlying issues that must be tackled during product discovery.</li>
    <li>Objective:
    <ol>
      <li>Agree on the problem.</li>
      <li>Identify big risk to be tackled ruing discovery work.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Product discovery and validation only when there is significant risk.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Discovery planning techniques:
  <ul>
    <li>To scope out and plan the discovery efforts.</li>
    <li>Customer discovery program:
    <ul>
      <li>Loads of work.</li>
      <li>Favourite leading indicator of future success.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Discovery ideation techniques.</li>
  <li>Discovery prototyping techniques:

</ol><h1><a name="ch-34-1"></a>Discovery framing techniques</h1><h2><a name="ch-35"></a>Chapter 35: Opportunity Assessment Technique</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Answer:
  <ol>
    <li>What business objective is this work intended to address? (Objective - Should match an OKR).</li>
    <li>How will you know if you&rsquo;ve succeeded? (Key result - Should match an OKR).</li>
    <li>What problem will this solve for our customers? (Customer problem).</li>
    <li>What type of customer are we focused on? (Target market).</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>It is responsibility of the PM to answer these questions.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-36"></a>Chapter 36: Customer Letter Technique</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For larger efforts.</li>
  <li>Write an imagined press release.</li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-39"></a>Chapter 39: Customer Discovery Program Technique</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simple best tool for marketing and sales is the happy reference customer:
  <ul>
    <li>Real (not family/friends).</li>
    <li>In production.</li>
    <li>Paying.</li>
    <li>Willing to tell others.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Discovery and developing a set of reference customers in parallel with discovery and developing the actual product.</li>
  <li>Substantial effort.</li>
  <li>Aim for 6 reference customers:
  <ul>
    <li>Same market.</li>
    <li>Recruit 8.</li>
    <li>Desperate for a solution, or a technologist.</li>
    <li>Willing to spend time with product team and testing prototypes.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Not building features for all reference customers, but a single solution that works for all of them.</li>
  <li>They do not pay in advance, it is a partner.</li>
  <li>If you cannot recruit even 4 or 5, you are probably chasing the wrong problem.</li>
  <li>Variations:
  <ul>
    <li>API/Platform products:
    <ul>
      <li>Reference apps instead of customers.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Customer-Enabling tools:
    <ul>
      <li>Well respected and influential internal users/employees.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Consumer products:
    <ul>
      <li>10-50 users.</li>
      <li>Supplement with much broad testing.</li>

    <li>At least 2-3 hours per week.</li>
    <li>Mindset: understand and learn. Not prove.</li>
    <li>About 1 hour.</li>
    <li>On their native habitat.</li>
    <li>Be clear on the problem you think they have, and how you will either confirm or contradict that.</li>
    <li>PM (takes notes) + engineer (listens) + product designer (leads).</li>
    <li>Open-ended questions, learn what they are doing today.</li>

    <li>PM + Designer + Engineer.</li>
    <li>Prepare set of tasks to test.</li>
    <li>Ask for candid feedback, good or bad.</li>

<ul>
  <li>You need to plan the way a fire department plans.</li>
  <li>You are not an employee. You are in a business with one employee: yourself.</li>
  <li>Aim is not whatever the customer wants whenever he wants it.</li>
  <li>Your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources:
  <ul>
    <li>There is one right answer.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Use pairing indicators: together both effect and counter-effect each other.</li>
  <li>Any measurement is better than none.</li>
  <li>Quality:
  <ul>
    <li>Balance desired result of the inspection:
    <ul>
      <li>Improved quality.</li>
      <li>Minimum disturbance to the production process.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Variable inspection: adjust monitoring rate to the recent quality levels.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Manager&rsquo;s output: output of group reporting to her + output of group under her influence.</li>
  <li>Individual contributors who gather and disseminate know-how and information should be seen as middle managers.</li>
  <li>Much of what we do often seems so inconsequential that our position in the business hardly seems justified.</li>
  <li>Information most useful to managers comes from quick, often casual verbal exchanges. Timely information is more valuable.</li>
  <li>Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information:
  <ul>
    <li>Writing a report is important; reading it is often not.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Manager activities:
  <ol>
    <li>Information-gathering: all other activities depend on this one.</li>
    <li>Conveying information.</li>
    <li>Decision-making.</li>
    <li>Nudging.</li>
    <li>Role model.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Increase output by either:
  <ol>
    <li>Increase # activities, aka speed up work.</li>
    <li>Increase leverage.</li>
    <li>Shift to activities with higher leverage:
    <ol>
      <li>When many people are affected by one manager.</li>
      <li>When a person&rsquo;s activity/behaviour over a long period of time is affected by a manager&rsquo;s brief, well-focused set of words/actions.</li>
      <li>When a large group is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge/information.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Delegate only activities that you are familiar with.</li>
  <li>Delegation without follow-through is abdication.</li>
  <li>One-to-one meetings:
  <ul>
    <li>Frequency depends on the task-relevant maturity of the subordinate.</li>
    <li>It is a subordinate meeting:
    <ul>
      <li>Agenda and tone set by subordinate.</li>
      <li>Because subordinate must prepare only one, while supervisor would prepare several.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Staff meetings:</li>
  <li>Anything that affect more than 2 subordinates.</li>
  <li>Supervisor learn from the exchange and confrontation that often develops, better than on 1-2-1.</li>
  <li>Supervisor role: leader, observer, expediter, questioner, decision-maker, moderator, facilitator.
  <ul>
    <li>NOT lecturer, as it undermines free discussion.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Managers get a little more obsolete (in the know-how) everyday.</li>
  <li>Any decision to be worked out and reached at the lowest level: people closest to the issue and with the most knowledge.</li>
  <li>Who should plan? Those implementing the plan.</li>
  <li>Management by objectives:
  <ul>
    <li>Answer 2 questions:
    <ol>
      <li>Where do I want to go? (Objective).</li>
      <li>How will I pace myself? (Key results).</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Should provide focus (== few objectives).</li>
    <li>Key results can be achieved, but the objective still missed.</li>
    <li>Not for individual performance review, but an input for it.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.</li>
  <li>Can an employee have two bosses? Tentative &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.
  <ol>
    <li>Mission-oriented manager: what business problem to work on.</li>
    <li>Technical manager: technical proficiency and career development.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Most appropriate mode of control:</li>
</ul><p><img src="/images/blog/books/high-output-management/mode-of-control.png" alt="model of control" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two reasons why somebody is not doing his job:
  <ol>
    <li>Not capable.</li>
    <li>Not motivated.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>If his life depended on it, could he do it?</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Motivation has to come from within:</li>
</ul><p><img src="/images/blog/books/high-output-management/maslow-hierarchy-motivation.png" alt="maslow hierarchy" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Manager as a coach:
  <ol>
    <li>Takes no personal credit for the success of his team, and because of that his players trust him.</li>
    <li>He is tough on his team.</li>
    <li>Likely he was a good player himself at one time: he understands the game well.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Would you cringe to deliver a tough performance review to your subordinate-friend?
  <ul>
    <li>If so, don&rsquo;t make friends at work.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Performance Appraisal:
  <ul>
    <li>One of the manager&rsquo;s highest leverage activities.</li>
    <li>Output measures (100% objective) + internal measures (what is done for the output of future periods).</li>
    <li>No way to do it completely objective.</li>
    <li>Will the subordinate remember all the messages? If not, remove the less important ones.</li>
    <li>We should spend more time trying to improve the performance of our top achievers as they account for a disproportionally large share of the work.</li>
    <li>Do not ask for a self-review: it is a supervisor responsibility.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If performance appraisal is difficult, interviewing is just about impossible.
  <ul>
    <li>The most insights come from discussing subjects familiar to both you and the candidate.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t worry about being blunt: direct questions tend to bring direct answers.</li>
    <li>A candidate can tell you a great deal by asking you questions.</li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-0"></a>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Being second best is a tough environment is just not good enough.</li>
  <li>Globalization: every person will compete with every person anywhere in the world who is capable of doing the same thing.</li>
  <li>When products and services become largely indistinguishable from each other, all there is by the way of competitive advantage is time.</li>
  <li>Book aimed to middle managers, and know-how managers (knowledge experts that sort of act as consultants).</li>
  <li>3 basic ideas:
  <ol>
    <li>Output-oriented approach to management.</li>
    <li>Not individuals but teams: the output from a manager is the output of the org units under his supervision or influence.
    <ul>
      <li>Managerial leverage.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>A team will perform well only if peak performance is elicited from individuals in it.
    <ul>
      <li>Task-relevant feedback.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>You need to plan the way a fire department plans.</li>
  <li>You are not an employee. You are in a business with one employee: yourself.</li>
</ul><h1><a name="part-1"></a>Part I: The Breakfast Factory</h1><h2><a name="ch-1"></a>Chapter 1: The Basics of Production: Delivering a Breakfast</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Aim:
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduled delivery time.</li>
    <li>Acceptable quality.</li>
    <li>Lowest cost.</li>
    <li>NOT: whatever the customer wants whenever he wants it.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Find the limiting step and schedule all work around it.</li>
  <li>Production principles:
  <ol>
    <li>Limiting step.</li>
    <li>Time offsets.</li>
    <li>Fundamental types of production operations:
    <ol>
      <li>Process.</li>
      <li>Assembly.</li>
      <li>Test.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Example: compiler:
  <ol>
    <li>Process: create the component.</li>
    <li>Test the individual components.</li>
    <li>Assemble into a compiler.</li>
    <li>System test.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Timing of the releases of various bodies of software from one stage to another can all be calculated and staged in advance. (Really???).</li>
  <li>Your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources:
  <ul>
    <li>There is one right answer.</li>
    <li>You must develop a clear understanding of the trade-offs between the various factors, and reduce this understanding to a quantifiable set of relationships.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Choose in-process tests over those that destroy product (how this translates to software?).</li>
  <li>Opportunity at risk: what would it cost to shut down until there are more raw materials? Customers lost * cost of bringing them back.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-2"></a>Chapter 2 - Managing the Breakfast Factory</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You have to focus each indicator on a specific operational goal.</li>
  <li>Use pairing indicators: together both effect and counter-effect each other.</li>
  <li>Any measurement is better than none.</li>
  <li>Effective indicators:
  <ol>
    <li>Cover the output, not simple the activity involved.</li>
    <li>Should measure physical countable things.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Benefits:
    <ol>
      <li>Spell out very clearly the objectives.</li>
      <li>Provide objectivity.</li>
      <li>Allow comparing teams.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Leading indicators:
  <ul>
    <li>Indication of what the future might look like.</li>
    <li>Only useful if they entice you to act.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Linearity indicator: progress vs time.</li>
  <li>Trend indicator: output measured against time and against some expected level.</li>
  <li>Staggered chart:
  <ul>
    <li>Forecast and when what it made in.</li>
    <li>Best means of getting a feeling for future business trends.</li>
    <li>Actual value in black.</li>

  <li>Managerial output == Leverage<sub>1</sub> * Activity<sub>1</sub> + L<sub>2</sub>*A<sub>2</sub> + L<sub>3</sub> * A<sub>3</sub>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase output by either:
    <ol>
      <li>Increase # activities, aka speed up work: Good time management:
      <ul>
        <li>Identify limiting step and schedule around it.</li>
        <li>Batching: to reduce task switching.</li>
        <li>Forecast:
        <ul>
          <li>Large portion of managerial work can be forecasted.</li>
          <li>Use your calendar as the medium to forecast.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Do not accept more work if you are at max capacity.</li>
        <li>Be proactive at filling holes in your calendar between the time-critical events.</li>
        <li>When you say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to one thing, you are inevitably saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to another.</li>
        <li>Allow for slack.</li>
        <li>Keep an inventory of project not urgent but important over the long term, so free time is used in these projects and not meddling.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Increase leverage.</li>
      <li>Shift to activities with higher leverage.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>High leverage activities:
    <ol>
      <li>When many people are affected by one manager.</li>
      <li>When a person&rsquo;s activity/behaviour over a long period of time is affected by a manager&rsquo;s brief, well-focused set of words/actions.</li>
      <li>When a large group is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge/information.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Managerial meddling has negative leverage:
  <ul>
    <li>Subordinate will show less initiative.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Delegate only activities that you are familiar with.</li>
  <li>Delegation without follow-through is abdication:
  <ul>
    <li>You are still responsible for its accomplishment.</li>
    <li>Monitoring is the only practical way to ensure a result.</li>
    <li>Monitoring != meddling.</li>
    <li>Monitoring == QA. Same principles:
    <ul>
      <li>Do it early, variable inspection.</li>
      <li>Go into some details randomly but not all details all the time.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>A manager should have 6-8 subordinates:
  <ul>
    <li>Half day per week per subordinate.</li>
    <li>For know-how managers, each planning, advisory, or coordination group counts as a subordinate.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Interruptions - the plague of managerial work:
  <ul>
    <li>Strive towards regularity.</li>
    <li>Because you need to coordinate with other managers, you can only move towards regularity if others do too.</li>
    <li>Reduce time spend handling interruptions by using standard responses.
    <ul>
      <li>Have regular scheduled time (like 1-2-1).</li>
      <li>Force interrupters to make an active decision about whether an issue can wait.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;I am doing individual work. Please don&rsquo;t interrupt me unless it really can&rsquo;t wait until 2pm&rdquo;.</li>
    </ul></li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-4"></a>Chapter 4 - Meetings - The Medium of Managerial Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 types:
  <ol>
    <li>Process-oriented meetings:
    <ul>
      <li>Knowledge is shared and information exchanged.</li>
      <li>Regular.</li>
      <li>Kinds:
      <ol>
        <li>One-to-one:
        <ul>
          <li>Mutual teaching and exchange of info.</li>
          <li>Frequency depends on the task-relevant maturity of the subordinate.</li>
          <li>Also depend on how fast things change.</li>
          <li>Should last one hour minimum.</li>
          <li>In or near the subordinate work area.</li>
          <li>Key point: it is a subordinate meeting:
          <ul>
            <li>Agenda and tone set by subordinate.</li>
            <li>Because subordinate must prepare only one, while supervisor would prepare several.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Content:
          <ul>
            <li>Performance/Indicators figures.</li>
            <li>Any problems or potential ones (even it is only intuition).</li>
            <li>Criteria: anything that preoccupy or nag the subordinate.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Supervisor role: learn and coach.</li>
          <li>Both take notes: help focus, commitment and follow up.</li>

        <li>Staff meetings
        <ul>
          <li>Supervisor + all subordinates.</li>
          <li>Interaction among peers.</li>
          <li>Decision-making by a group of peers is not easy.</li>
          <li>Supervisor learn from the exchange and confrontation that often develops, better than on 1-2-1.</li>
          <li>Content:
          <ul>
            <li>Anything that affect more than 2 subordinates.</li>
            <li>Agenda + open session.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Supervisor role: leader, observer, expediter, questioner, decision-maker, moderator, facilitator.
          <ul>
            <li>NOT lecturer, as it undermines free discussion.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Supervision should be &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; while subordinates &ldquo;active&rdquo;.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Operation reviews:
        <ul>
          <li>Teaching and learning between employees several organizational levels apart.</li>
          <li>Roles:

              <li>Senior supervisor at whom the review is aimed.</li>
              <li>Ask questions, make comments, catalyst to audience participation.</li>
              <li>Role model for junior managers.</li>
              <li>Should never preview the material.</li>

            <li>Audience:
            <ul>
              <li>You are being paid to attend: pay attention, ask questions, make comments.</li>

        </ul></li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Mission-Oriented meetings:
    <ul>
      <li>Adhoc to produce a specific output.</li>
      <li>The chairman is responsible for the result and must have a clear understanding of the meeting objective. Ask yourself:
      <ul>
        <li>What I am trying to accomplish?</li>
        <li>Is a meeting necessary/desirable/justifiable?</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Beware of the dollar cost of the meeting.</li>
      <li>Avoid more than 6 people. 8 Max.</li>
      <li>Chairman:
      <ul>
        <li>Agenda.</li>
        <li>Role of each participant.</li>
        <li>Commitment from each participant.</li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-5"></a>Chapter 5 - Decisions, Decisions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The faster the change in the know-how, the greater the divergence between knowledge and position power is likely to be.
  <ul>
    <li>Managers get a little more obsolete everyday.</li>
    <li>Key to success is middle manager that mesh smoothly the holder of the two types of power.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Ideal decision model:
  <ol>
    <li>Free discussion.</li>
    <li>Clear decision.</li>
    <li>Full support.</li>
    <li>Go to 1 if decision was wrong.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Easy one to follow for senior managers and newly graduates.</li>
    <li>Any decision to be worked out and reached at the lowest level: people closest to the issue and with the most knowledge.</li>
    <li>Good decisions need expertise + judgment (== experience).</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The Peer-Group Syndrome:
  <ul>
    <li>Peers are afraid to stick out their necks.</li>
    <li>Peers going in circles until consensus is developed, due the fear of:
    <ul>
      <li>Sounding dumb (specially seniors).</li>
      <li>Being overruled (specially juniors).</li>
      <li>Not enough business or technical knowledge.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>No proper discussion happens, hence best decision is not made.</li>
    <li>Push for consensus, and failing that, step in and make a decision.
    <ul>
      <li>Not too early, not too late.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Answer:
  <ul>
    <li>What decision?</li>
    <li>When?</li>
    <li>Who will decide?</li>
    <li>Who needs to be consulted?</li>
    <li>Who can veto/ratify?</li>
    <li>Who needs to be informed?</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Politics and manipulation or even their appearance should be avoided at all costs.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-6"></a>Chapter 6 - Planning: Today&rsquo;s Actions for Tomorrow&rsquo;s Output</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Steps:
  <ol>
    <li>Determine environmental demand:
    <ul>
      <li>What your clients want now?</li>
      <li>What your clients will want in X months/years?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Determine present status:
    <ul>
      <li>Should be stated in the same terms (currency, widgets, outputs) as the demand.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Determine what to do to close the gap:
    <ul>
      <li>What do you need to close the gap?</li>
      <li>What can you do to close the gap?</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Today&rsquo;s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.</li>
  <li>The output of the planning process is the decisions made and the actions taken as result of the process.</li>
  <li>How often to plan? Give enough time to get feedback on the last planning process.</li>
  <li>Who should plan? Those implementing the plan.</li>
  <li>Management by objectives:
  <ul>
    <li>Concern only with steps 2 and 3 of planning.</li>
    <li>Answer 2 questions:
    <ol>
      <li>Where do I want to go? (Objective).</li>
      <li>How will I pace myself? (Key results).</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Should provide focus (== few objectives).</li>
    <li>Key results can be achieved, but the objective still missed.</li>
    <li>Not for individual performance review, but an input for it.</li>
    <li>No room for ambiguity in key results.</li>
  </ul></li>

<ul>
  <li>Centralization-decentralization dichotomy.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-8"></a>Chapter 8 - Hybrid Organizations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Two extremes:
  <ol>
    <li>Totally mission-oriented:
    <ul>
      <li>Completely decentralized.</li>
      <li>Independent.</li>
      <li>Responsible.</li>
      <li>More responsive: this is critical for a business unit.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Totally functional form:
    <ul>
      <li>Economies of scale.</li>
      <li>Increase leverage.</li>
      <li>More flexibility moving resources/people on corporate-wide priorities.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Hybrid: mix of both:
  <ul>
    <li>Business units: decentralized.</li>
    <li>Functional groups:
    <ul>
      <li>Centralized.</li>
      <li>Viewed as internal subcontractors.</li>
      <li>Information overload to serve all business units.</li>
      <li>Negotiation and competition for their time/resources.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.</li>
</ul><p><img src="/images/blog/books/high-output-management/matrix-organization.png" alt="matrix organization" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Most important task of hybrid orgs is the optimum and timely allocation of its resources and the efficient resolution of conflicts arising over that allocation:
  <ul>
    <li>Central &ldquo;allocators&rdquo; is not the answer.</li>
    <li>Middle managers are:
    <ol>
      <li>They are numerous.</li>
      <li>They are close to the problem.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>To succeed they need:
      <ol>
        <li>Accept the hybrid org form.</li>
        <li>Develop and master dual reporting.</li>
      </ol></li>

</ul><h2><a name="ch-9"></a>Chapter 9 - Dual Reporting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can an employee have two bosses? Tentative &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>Matrix management:
  <ul>
    <li>Core idea is that a project manager (outside the contracting company) could wield as much influence on the work of units within a given contractor company as could the company management itself.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>We want the immediacy and the operating priorities coming from the general manager, plus a technical supervisory relationship.</li>
  <li>The technical supervisor role can be filled by a group of peers:
  <ul>
    <li>Required the voluntary surrender of individual decision-making to the group.</li>
    <li>This requires trust in the peer group, which requires a strong and positive culture.</li>
    <li>Makes manager&rsquo;s life ambiguous.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Two bosses:
  <ol>
    <li>Mission-oriented manager: what business problem to work on.</li>
    <li>Technical manager: technical proficiency and career development.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Multi-plane organization:
  <ul>
    <li>Mission-oriented org chart is a plane, while technical org chart is another.</li>
    <li>There can be more than two planes, some will be temporal.</li>
    <li>Having multiple planes (org charts) allow for the optimal organization for a given problem/objective.</li>

    <li>Free-market forces:
    <ul>
      <li>Like choosing what/where tires to buy.</li>
      <li>Self-interest.</li>
      <li>Requires a clear dollar value, which within an org is hard to establish.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Contractual obligations:

      <li>Like stopping at a ref traffic light.</li>
      <li>Obey the law.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Cultural values:
    <ul>
      <li>Like helping on an accident while exposing yourself to danger.</li>
      <li>When environment changes more rapidly than one can change rules.</li>
      <li>When a set of circumstances is so ambiguous and unclear that a contract would be prohibitively complicated.</li>
      <li>Interest of the group takes precedence over the interest of the individual.</li>
      <li>Emotions.</li>
      <li>Requires shared values, objectives and methods.
      <ul>
        <li>It is management&rsquo;s role to articulate these and be an example.</li>

<ul>
  <li>A team will perform only as well as the individuals on it.</li>
  <li>Manager can elicit peak individual performance.</li>
  <li>Two reasons why somebody is not doing his job:
  <ol>
    <li>Not capable.</li>
    <li>Not motivated.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>If his life depended on it, could he do it?</li>
    <li>To improve performance:
    <ol>
      <li>Training.</li>
      <li>Motivation.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Motivation has to come from within:
  <ul>
    <li>All a manager can do is create an environment in which motivated people can flourish.</li>
    <li>Maslow&rsquo;s theory of motivation:
    <ul>
      <li>Needs cause people to have drives, which in turn result in motivation.</li>
      <li>No need, no motivation.</li>
      <li>When a lower need is satisfied, one higher is likely to take over.</li>
      <li>Physiological needs: things money can buy.</li>
      <li>Security/safety needs: protect oneself from going back to physiological needs.</li>
      <li>Social/Affiliation needs: belong to a group that share something in common.</li>
      <li>Esteem/recognition needs: need to keep up with or emulate someone/some group.</li>
      <li>Self-actualization:
      <ul>
        <li>Personal realization: &ldquo;What I can be, I must be&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Two types:
        <ol>
          <li>Competency-driven: mastery.</li>
          <li>Achievement-driven:
          <ul>
            <li>Abstract need to achieve in all that you do.</li>
            <li>Spontaneously test the limit of their abilities.</li>
            <li>This is why OKR should be unachievable/impossible.</li>
          </ul></li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>Person needs to measure his progress/achievements.</li>
        <li>Measure by feedback on his performance.</li>
        <li>For competency-driven, feedback comes from within that individual.</li>
        <li>At work, performance indicators and milestones linked to the individual&rsquo;s performance.</li>
        <li>Fear of failure can become a negative source of motivation if it becomes preoccupation.</li>

    </ul></li>
    <li>Manager as a coach:
    <ol>

<ul>
  <li>See <a href="/2020/04/01/no-nonsense-leadership-summary/#ch-2">Chapter 2 of No-nonsense Leadership</a>.</li>
  <li>High output is associated with particular combinations of certain managers and certain groups of workers:
  <ul>
    <li>The fundamental variable that tells you what management styles is most appropriate is task-relevant maturity (TRM) of a subordinate.</li>
    <li>TRM:
    <ul>
      <li>Achievement orientation +</li>
      <li>Readiness to take responsibility +</li>
      <li>Education +</li>
      <li>Training +</li>
      <li>Experience.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>TRM is task specific.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Three levels:
  <ol>
    <li>Low:
    <ul>
      <li>Structured task-oriented</li>
      <li>Tell what/when/how.</li>
      <li>Detailed instructions.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Medium:
    <ul>
      <li>Emphasis on two-way communication.</li>
      <li>Emotional support.</li>
      <li>Encouragement.</li>
      <li>Focus more on the individual than the task.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>High:
    <ul>
      <li>Minimal involvement.</li>
      <li>Focus on agreeing on objectives.</li>
      <li>Monitoring.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Highest levels of TRM the training is complete, and the subordinate&rsquo;s motivation is likely self-actualization.</li>
  <li>Deciding on your subordinates TRM is not easy, but even if the manager knows the TRM, his personal preferences tend to override the proper choice of management style.</li>
  <li>Would you cringe to deliver a tough performance review to your subordinate-friend?
  <ul>
    <li>If so, don&rsquo;t make friends at work.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-13"></a>Chapter 13 - Performance Appraisal: Manager as Judge and Jury</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One of the manager&rsquo;s highest leverage activities.</li>
  <li>Main purpose is to improve the subordinate&rsquo;s performance:
  <ol>
    <li>What skills are missing and how to remedy that lack.</li>
    <li>Intensify subordinate&rsquo;s motivation.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Delivering a good performance review is very hard due to our professional training and our cultural background as our society values avoiding confrontation.</li>
  <li>Assessing performance:
  <ul>
    <li>Output measures (100% objective) + internal measures (what is done for the output of future periods).</li>
    <li>No way to do it completely objective.</li>
    <li>Weight of output vs internal should be clear from the beginning.</li>
    <li>Time offset: time it takes the subordinate&rsquo;s activity to have an effect on the output.</li>
    <li>Manager&rsquo;s review should include both the performance of his group and his own performance.</li>
    <li>Avoid the &ldquo;potential trap&rdquo;: manager shows good forms but output of group is poor.</li>
    <li>No matter how well a subordinate has done his job, we can always find ways to suggest improvements.</li>

        <li>The credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on you being totally frank.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Listen:
      <ul>
        <li>If your subordinate&rsquo;s response (verbal and non-verbal) to the assessment do not completely assure you that what you&rsquo;ve said has gotten through, it is your responsibility to keep at it until you are satisfied that you have been heard and understood.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Leave yourself out:
      <ul>
        <li>Control your emotions, so they do not affect your task.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Review should have no surprises, but if you uncover one, swallow hard and bring it up.</li>
  <li>3 types of performance review:
  <ol>
    <li>On the one hand &hellip; on the other &hellip;:
    <ul>
      <li>Most reviews.</li>
      <li>Avoid: superficiality, cliches, and laundry list.</li>
      <li>People has finite capacity, so target a few key areas.</li>
      <li>Prep:
      <ol>
        <li>Write down everything you can think of (brain dump, no mental editing).</li>
        <li>Find relationship between items.</li>
        <li>For each relationship, write a &ldquo;message&rdquo; for the subordinate.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Will the subordinate remember all the messages? If not, remove the less important ones.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The blast:
    <ul>
      <li>Major performance problem.</li>
      <li>Stages:<br/> <img src="/images/blog/books/high-output-management/bad-performance-apprisal-phases.png" alt="bad performance stages" /></li>
      <li>Outcomes:
      <ol>
        <li>Agree on assessment and solution.</li>
        <li>Disagree on assessment but agree/commit on solution.</li>
        <li>Disagree on assessment and solution.</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Outcomes 1 and 2 are ok.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Reviewing the Ace:
    <ul>
      <li>Typical issue: review is about past achievements, and not about future performance improvements.</li>
      <li>We should spend more time trying to improve the performance of our top achievers as they account for a disproportionally large share of the work.</li>
      <li>Concentrating on the top achievers is a high leverage activity: if they get better, the impact on the group output is very great indeed.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Do not ask for a self-review: it is a supervisor responsibility.</li>
  <li>Provide the appraisal before the face-to-face meeting.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-14"></a>Chapter 14 - Two Difficult Tasks</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Interviewing:
  <ul>
    <li>If performance appraisal is difficult, interviewing is just about impossible.</li>
    <li>Applicant should do 80% of the talking, but you are in control:
    <ul>
      <li>Gently interrupt if things go off track.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The most insights come from discussing subjects familiar to both you and the candidate.</li>
    <li>4 categories:
    <ol>
      <li>Technical/skills:
      <ul>
        <li>Describe some project.</li>
        <li>What are your weakness.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>What he did with knowledge:
      <ul>
        <li>Past achievements.</li>
        <li>Past failures.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Discrepancies:
      <ul>
        <li>What did you learn from failures.</li>
        <li>Problem in current position.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Operational values:
      <ul>
        <li>Why are you ready for a new job.</li>
        <li>Why should my company hire you.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>You must judge potential contribution.</li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t worry about being blunt: direct questions tend to bring direct answers.</li>
    <li>A candidate can tell you a great deal by asking you questions.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>&ldquo;I quit!&rdquo;:
  <ul>
    <li>High value employee that quits from reasons other than compensation.</li>
    <li>Usually he feels unrecognized.</li>
    <li>Your initial reaction to his announcement is absolutely crucial:
    <ul>
      <li>Drop everything, sit down and ask him why.</li>
      <li>Let him talk and then ask him more questions until real reasons emerge.</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t argue, lecture or panic.</li>
      <li>Buy time for next round.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ol><h2><a name="ch-15"></a>Chapter 15 - Compensation as Task-Relevant Feedback</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Money has significance at all levels of Maslow&rsquo;s motivation hierarchy.</li>
  <li>The percentage the bonus represents of a manager&rsquo;s total compensation should rise with his total compensation.</li>
  <li>Base salary should be a mix of experience and merit.</li>
  <li>Peter Principle: employee gets promoted until he reaches his level of incompetence, and then stays there:
  <ul>
    <li>More accurate: an employee moves in cycles:
    <ol>
      <li>&ldquo;Meets expectations&rdquo;.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Exceed expectations&rdquo;.</li>
      <li>Promotion. Go to 1.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>If employee does not meet expectations after promotion:
    <ol>
      <li>Should be &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; to previous position until ready.</li>
      <li>Is a management misjudgement.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="ch-16"></a>Chapter 16 - Why Training Is The Boss&rsquo;s Job</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For training to be effective, it has to be closely tied to how things are actually done in your org.</li>
  <li>Training should be a process, not an event.</li>
  <li>Training must be done by a person who represents a suitable role model.</li>
  <li>Skills that you have had for years are much harder to explain than to practice.</li>
  <li>Regard the first time you teach a course as a throw-away:
  <ul>
    <li>No matter how hard you try, it won&rsquo;t be great.</li>
    <li>Give this first course to the most knowledgeable of your subordinates, who won&rsquo;t be confused and will help to improve it.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If it is your first time teaching, you&rsquo;ll discover:
  <ol>
    <li>Training is hard.</li>
    <li>You are the one that will learn the most.</li>
    <li>If training goes well, it is nothing short of exhilarating.</li>

If something needs of a longer explanation let me know!</p><h1>Truths</h1>
<ul>
  <li>They are messy.</li>
  <li>Third parties will become unavailable, both in small doses (few requests &ldquo;randomly&rdquo; failing) and in big ones (few minutes or hours of downtime).</li>
  <li>SFTP is a perfectly acceptable way of integrating.</li>
</ul><h1>Practices</h1><h2>Initial implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Read the docs.
  <ul>
    <li>Do not just fiddle with the endpoints but read the actual docs.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Play with the API to understand behaviours. What if:
  <ul>
    <li>the url is wrong? Does it return a 404?</li>
    <li>the data queried does not exist? Empty result or 404?</li>
    <li>we miss some query/body parameters?</li>
    <li>we concurrently update the same piece of information?</li>
    <li>we exceed the rate limit?</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Estimate call rate and data volumes:
  <ul>
    <li>Is batching available?</li>
    <li>Is pagination available?</li>
    <li>Get a sense of the performance:
    <ul>
      <li>It might affect the implementation and business flow.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Document findings
  <ul>
    <li>Include support contact information and expectations.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Subscribe the provider&rsquo;s status page.</li>
  <li>Find out what is their change management process:
  <ul>
    <li>Subscribe to whatever you need to subscribe to find out about changes.</li>
    <li>Is it a newly built third party?
    <ul>
      <li>Try to get direct access to their technical team.</li>
      <li>Expect loads of backwards incompatible changes.</li>
      <li>VS mature products, higher chance that the bug is on their side.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Consider a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DarkLaunching.html">dark launch</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Put the integration in production, so it is exercised but do not use it in a client facing functionality.</li>
    <li>Minimum monitoring (error and performance) required for this to be useful.</li>
    <li>Useful also to collect real example responses to use for additional testing.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2>On the way to production</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What is the acceptable business process when the integration fails?
  <ul>
    <li>Integration will fail.</li>
    <li>Avoid &ldquo;at all costs&rdquo; making an integration mandatory for a key user flow.</li>
    <li>What is the fallback mechanism? Default answer?</li>
    <li>If there is a reasonable business flow, consider recording which user flows where affected and proper actions retried/amended/reviewed/notified.</li>
    <li>It is a business decision.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Add retries:
  <ul>
    <li>Think of clock time, not number of retries.</li>
    <li>Consider supporting a manual retry mechanism for your support folks.</li>
    <li>See &ldquo;user-flow vs background integrations below&rdquo;.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Add a kill-switch:
  <ul>
    <li>Ideally in the hands of a PM.</li>
    <li>Review &ldquo;What is the acceptable business process when the integration fails&rdquo;.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Always set timeouts in network calls:
  <ul>
    <li>In the case of Apache HTTP client, <a href="/2019/12/11/apache-http-client-timeouts-config-production-asynchronous-http-client-pictures">at least connection and read timeout</a>.</li>
    <li>Consider that while the thread is waiting for a response, it might be holding other resources (locks, db connections) hostage, which might affect unrelated requests.</li>
    <li>Review &ldquo;What is the acceptable business process when the integration fails&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Note: when there is a read timeout while waiting for the server to respond, the client side does not know if the request was processed or not.</li>
    <li>Note: if the client application crashes, any in-flight request to the provider ends up in an unknown state from the client&rsquo;s point of view.
    <ul>
      <li>Consider a retry/recovery mechanism when the client application starts up.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If you can influence it, encourage the provider to implement idempotent APIs:
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;At least once&rdquo; semantics are way easier than &ldquo;at most once&rdquo;.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You might want to consider splitting one third party API into smaller independent integrations if:
  <ul>
    <li>Some endpoints are more critical than others for your business process.</li>
    <li>The various endpoints have widely different latencies.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Monitoring:
  <ul>
    <li>Call rate, error rate, latency.</li>
    <li>Logs:
    <ul>
      <li>All calls.</li>
      <li>Request/Response body in the case of an error.
      <ul>
        <li>Careful with PII data.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Side note: client side monitoring is always better than server side monitoring, as the server might not see some requests if they never reach it, or it might miss monitoring data if it is struggling with load/network/crashing.
      <ul>
        <li>Server side monitoring is still required.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Set alerts:
  <ul>
    <li>Useful distinction between errors:
    <ul>
      <li>4xx:
      <ul>
        <li>It&rsquo;s our fault.</li>
        <li>Most likely something that we can do about it.</li>
        <li>Daily/weekly report:
        <ul>
          <li>Daily the first few weeks.</li>
          <li>Only alert if % is very high.</li>
          <li>Very unlikely that a retry will help.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>5xx and timeouts/network errors:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/2016/11/21/the-boy-who-cried-wolf-an-it-tale/">Do not alert on each and every error</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Timeout and 5xx will happen and are normal.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Too many:
        <ul>
          <li>First few weeks might mean that you need to tweak your timeouts:
          <ul>
            <li>Dark launch!</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Escalate to the provider team.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Retries will help.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>In both cases, keep a close eye the first time that you release an integration.</li>
      <li>Remember that GraphQL needs <a href="https://productionreadygraphql.com/2020-08-01-guide-to-graphql-errors">additional error handling</a>.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>If you are doing out of hours escalation, ensure that the person to be contacted when there is an alert is the person that thinks that the alert deserves an out of hours alert.
    <ul>
      <li>Most likely it is an issue with the provider, so it &ldquo;only&rdquo; needs to be escalated to their support.</li>
      <li>Provide a dashboard for that alert that even a PM will understand.</li>
      <li>Provide a phone contact to the third party support.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>See &ldquo;user-flow vs background integrations below&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Consider doing load testing.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Security:
  <ul>
    <li>SSL.</li>
    <li>IP allow-list.</li>
    <li>Credentials rotation:
    <ul>
      <li>If it is not automated, figure out who to contact.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>On start up, check that the credentials are valid.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2>Practices for user-flow vs background integrations</h2><p>The main difference between API integration that is in a user-flow and integration that runs in some background process is that the user-flow integrations require a low latency, as it is unlikely that users are willing to wait long.</p><h4>Background integrations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple retries:
  <ul>
    <li>Consider exponential backoff.</li>
    <li>Think in terms of clock time: For how many minutes/hours is the business process still meaningful? Or is it pointless if delayed more than X?
    <ul>
      <li>Business decision.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Alerts:
  <ul>
    <li>Think in terms of clock time: how long can this integration be down before somebody should panic?
    <ul>
      <li>Business decision.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Consider alerting before the process runs out of retries, so that once the issue is addressed the process will (hopefully) successfully retry.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Timeouts can be longer: up to minutes could be ok.</li>
  <li>Batching is more likely to be useful.</li>
  <li>No need for circuit-breakers.</li>
  <li>Rate-limiting should result in traffic shaping.</li>
</ul><h4>User-flow integrations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You cannot wait long as there is a human looking at a spinning icon on the other side, so:
  <ul>
    <li>No more than one retry.</li>
    <li>Short timeouts.</li>
    <li>This in terms of clock time: how long will the human be willing to wait for the result to appear on their screen before they think your app is broken?</li>
    <li>Most of the time, a few seconds tops.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Connection pools are a must:
  <ul>
    <li>Unless your call rate is so low that it will make no difference.</li>
    <li>Each integration should have its own connection pool:
    <ul>
      <li>Do not share connection pools between different integrations.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Configure the connection pool timeout and the TTL.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Circuit breakers are a must.</li>
  <li>Consider stale-while-revalidating + stale-while-error for cached authorization tokens and data:
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce extra latency when the token/data is stale.</li>
    <li>Better resilience: set refresh short enough that any transient error in the provider will not affect the user as the refresh will be retried several times before it comes really stale.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Alerts:
  <ul>
    <li>Based on circuit breakers.</li>
    <li>Think in terms of clock time:
    <ul>
      <li>For how long a circuit breaker must be open before somebody should panic?</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Most PaaS platforms have a hard time limit to process the request.</li>
  <li>Consider:
  <ul>
    <li>Moving to a completely or mostly async IO model, to avoid thread starvation.</li>
    <li><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-loom-virtual-threads-platform-threads">Java virtual threads</a>!</li>
    <li>Sync data from the provider in a background process, store locally and serve from local store.</li>
    <li>Splitting processing into two steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Trigger request to provider on first client request.</li>
      <li>Client to periodically poll to check if the response is ready.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><h2>Annoyances</h2><p>A list of things that should never happen, and do not make sense at all, but you will need to live with.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expect the integration to behave out of spec:
  <ul>
    <li>Be kind with the provider&rsquo;s developers.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>A 200 response does not mean a successful response:
  <ul>
    <li>Look at something inside the response to confirm that it was a successful response.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Health check endpoints tell you that the health check endpoint is working (or not):
  <ul>
    <li>Making this call does not guarantee the success of the following HTTP request:
    <ul>
      <li>Health check implementations usually just return a 200 if the API server is up, but do not check that all the downstream dependencies are up and running.
      <ul>
        <li>Doing so is usually very expensive.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Even if the health check endpoint does health checking of downstream servers and the downstream servers of the downstream servers, it is possible that by the time we send the second request, the API server or any of its dependencies is frozen or dead, or that there is some network issue on the path.</li>
    <li>Making this call makes the error handling and logic more complex.</li>
    <li>So, avoid.</li>
    <li>See &ldquo;Side note: client side monitoring is always better than server side monitoring&rdquo;.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Probably the dev environment of the provider is crap:
  <ul>
    <li>Consider using their staging in all pre-production environments.</li>
    <li>Use their dev environment for initial development.</li>
  </ul></li>

Pen and paper.</p><p>Once you finish the book, leave it aside for a few weeks.</p><p>Next, prune the handwritten notes while moving them to electronic form. Leave it aside for a few weeks.</p><p>Last, summarize the notes into key learning and publish in your blog.</p><h2>The benefits</h2><h3>1. More focus, more learning</h3><p>Taking notes by hand has two benefits:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Handwriting notes forces me to focus on what I am reading, improving my understanding and retention of the material.</li>
  <li>As writing the notes is laborious, I tend to write fewer notes, which means trying to understand the key points, which in turn means learning more.
  <ul>
    <li>This is in contrast with highlighting text in an ebook.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol><h3>Retain more due to repetition</h3><p>Repetition. I ‚Äúread‚Äù a book at least four times:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The actual reading.</li>
  <li>Writing the notes to the notebook.</li>
  <li>Reading the notes and writing them back notes to electronic form.</li>
  <li>Summarizing the electronic forms.</li>
</ol><p>As several weeks have passed, for both steps 3 and 4 I have to go back to the book to understand what some notes mean.</p><p>Step 3 will be especially effective if your handwriting is as crappy as mine:</p><p><img src="/images/blog/books/notes-book-notes/book-notes.jpg" alt="Book notes" /></p><p>This will require you to go back to the book to figure out what you wrote and why it was important.</p><h3>No book left behind</h3><p>If you have abandoned a book for a few weeks, it can be a struggle to pick up where you left off.</p><p>With notes in hand, however, you can quickly refresh your memory and get back into the flow of the book.</p><p>I have found that my abandon rate has dropped significantly since I started taking notes.</p>
<p class="sidenote">my abandon rate of ebooks is significantly higher than paper books, hence I avoid ebooks as much as possible.</p><h3>Fast refresh, future reminder</h3><p>Key learnings take two minutes to read, and the full notes five. This means that it is effortless to re-read them from time to time, reinforcing your memory.</p><p>And, obviously, being in electronic form makes them searchable.</p><h3>Doing two things at once</h3><p>In <a href="/2019/11/27/becoming-a-technical-leader-book-notes/">Becoming a Technical Leader</a>, Weinberg recommends trying to do two things at once, but not in the sense of multitasking but in the sense of killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>In my case, taking notes means that I am both reading a book, having a quick reference for my future self, and at the same time generating content for my blog.</p><h2>Drawbacks</h2><p>Absolutely none.</p><p>Oooooookkk, maybe all this process takes significantly more time, but I wish I had started with my very first book:</p><p><img src="/images/blog/books/notes-book-notes/all-books.jpg" alt="All books" /></p><h2>Tools</h2><p>Some geekery about what do I use:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3mE31tG">Oxford Notepad</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>A5 is THE right size.</li>
    <li>Spiral because:
    <ol>
      <li>holds the pen.</li>

  <li>When to avoid:
  <ul>
    <li>Start ups:
    <ul>
      <li>Because no stable service boundaries.</li>
      <li>Small teams.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>SW deployed by customers, due to operation burden. <img src="/images/blog/books/building-microservices/collaboration-style.png" alt="communication style" /></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Keep your middleware dumb, and keep the smarts in the endpoints.</li>
  <li>Prefer to put into an event what you would be happy to share via an API.</li>
  <li>Ideal technology should:
  <ol>
    <li>Make backwards compatibility easy.</li>
    <li>Make interfaces explicit.</li>
    <li>Keep your APIs technology-agnostic.</li>
    <li>Make services simple for consumers.</li>
    <li>Hide internal implementation details.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Communication:
  <ul>
    <li>RPC:
    <ul>
      <li>gRPC good, other bad.</li>
      <li>Use when good deal of control of client and server.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>REST:
    <ul>
      <li>Sensible default choice.</li>
      <li>Good for external API: wide support + caching.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a>: No practical advantage.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>GraphQL:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic queries can cause stability issues similar to a big/slow/resource intensive SQL query affecting the whole system.</li>
      <li>CDN caching more difficult.</li>
      <li>Write requests are awkward.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Message brokers:
    <ul>
      <li>What any given broker technology means by guaranteed delivery can vary. Read the documentation very carefully.</li>
      <li>Pay really careful attention to how exactly once delivery is implemented (if it is).
      <ul>
        <li>Even better, expect duplicates.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Author still a fan of XML.</li>
  <li>Client libraries should be created by team other than the one that owns the server API.</li>
  <li>Sagas:
  <ul>
    <li>Saga gives enough information to reason about what state it is in.</li>
    <li>Sagas assume the underlying components are reliable as it does not deal with technical failures (5xx, timeouts).</li>
    <li>General rule:
    <ul>
      <li>If a team owns the implementation of the entire saga: orchestration.</li>
      <li>If multiple teams: choreographed.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>We want to build artifacts once and only once, and use them for all deployments.</li>
  <li>Source code organization:
  <ul>
    <li>Multirepo:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are constantly making changes across multiple services, your microservices boundaries are wrong.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Monorepo:
    <ul>
      <li>Ease changes in multiple services:
      <ul>
        <li>Atomic commits (but not atomic deployments).</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Needs load of tooling:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://bazel.build">Bazel</a>.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Per team monorepo.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>3 services per dev is not an uncommon ratio.</li>
  <li>The smarter the PaaS try to be, the more they go wrong.</li>
  <li>If you need to do a lot of fine tuning around resources available to your functions, then FaaS is not the best option.</li>
  <li>Explore FaaS before Kubernetes.</li>
  <li>Future: Kubernetes hidden under a more developer friendly experience.</li>
  <li>If your teams work independently, it follows that they should be able to test independently:
  <ul>
    <li>If also follows that they should own their test environments.</li>
    <li>It is a reason against end-to-end tests.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Contract testing and consumer-driven contracts:
  <ul>
    <li>Pair consumer and producer team members to write them.</li>
    <li>Make existing communication channels more explicit.</li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker">Pact Broker</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-contract">Spring Cloud Contract</a>. Only JVM.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Monitoring:
  <ol>
    <li>Log aggregation:
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid log forwarding agents reformatting the logs. Make services log in the right format.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Metrics aggregation:
    <ul>
      <li>Look for a product that is built with high cardinality in mind, so you can attach more metadata/tags to the metrics.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Distributed tracing:
    <ul>
      <li>Pick a tool that supports <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a>.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Semantic monitoring:
    <ul>
      <li>Are we selling &ldquo;as usual&rdquo;?</li>
      <li>Implemented with:
      <ol>
        <li>Real user monitoring: In the past.</li>
        <li>Synthetic transactions: Catch issues before clients are aware.</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Be sceptical of ML/AI.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Good alert:
  <ul>
    <li>Relevant.</li>
    <li>Unique.</li>
    <li>Timely.</li>
    <li>Prioritized.</li>
    <li>Understandable.</li>
    <li>Diagnostic: clear what is wrong.</li>
    <li>Advisory: help understand what actions to take.</li>
    <li>Focusing.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Standardization:
  <ul>
    <li>Make it easy to do the right thing.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You are only as secure as your least secure aspect.</li>
  <li>Credentials of users and operators are often the weakest point of our system:
  <ul>
    <li>In 2020, 80% of hacks due to it.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Cost of any security implementation should be justified by your threat model.</li>
  <li>Failure is everywhere:
  <ul>
    <li>Spend less time trying to stop the inevitable and more dealing with it gracefully.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Root cause analysis: it is surprising how often we want that root cause to be a human.</li>
  <li>CQRS: one of the hardest forms of scaling.</li>
  <li>The ideal number of places to cache is zero.</li>
  <li>When customizing a product built by someone else, you have to work in their world.</li>
  <li>One experience, one backend for frontend (BFF).</li>
  <li>Collective ownership can allow for more standardization, hence easier to move people/work around.</li>
  <li>The biggest cost to working efficiently at scale is the need of coordination.</li>
  <li>Coming up with a vision without considering how your staff will feel about it and without considering what capabilities they have is likely to lead to a bad place.</li>
  <li>Architecture is what happens, not what is planned.</li>
  <li>Make Product Manager accountable for the technical quality of the system.</li>

  <li>Boundaries:
  <ul>
    <li>Information hiding.</li>
    <li>Strong cohesion:
    <ul>
      <li>Code that changes together, stays together.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Low coupling.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Types of coupling, from low to high:
  <ol>
    <li>Domain coupling:
    <ul>
      <li>Unavoidable: one service calling another.</li>
      <li>Beware of one service talking to too many downstream services:
      <ul>
        <li>Too much logic centralized.</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God &ldquo;class&rdquo;</a>.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Pass-through coupling:
    <ul>
      <li>One service passes data to another purely because the data is needed further downstream.</li>
      <li>Fix by:
      <ol>
        <li>Bypass the intermediary:
        <ul>
          <li>Increase the domain coupling of calling service.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Required information to become part of the intermediary contract:
        <ul>
          <li>Intermediary to collect all/part of that data.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Intermediary to treat required information as a blob:
        <ul>
          <li>The Clojure way!</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Common coupling:
    <ul>
      <li>Two services using the same data.</li>
      <li>Okish for reference data ( low change, read only).</li>
      <li>Service that are thin wrappers around CRUD, is a sign of weak cohesion and high coupling.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Content coupling:
    <ul>
      <li>Upstream service reaches into the internals of a downstream service and changes its internal state.</li>
      <li>Other services touching your DB directly.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>To model:
  <ol>
    <li>Mainly, use DDD:
    <ul>
      <li>Both aggregates and bounded context give us the unit of cohesion with well defined interfaces: candidates for microservices.</li>
      <li>Coarser-grained bounded context can contain/hide other bounded context.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Event Storming.</li>
    <li>Other forces:
    <ul>
      <li>Volatility: things that change frequently should go into their own service.</li>
      <li>Data: PII/PCI.</li>
      <li>Technology: use the right tool for the job.</li>
      <li>Organizational: Conway&rsquo;s law.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Onion architecture: it has lots of layers and makes you cry when you have to cut through it.</li>

    </ul></li>
    <li>Multirepo:

  <li>Sizing teams:
  <ul>
    <li>The fundamental challenge of organizational design.</li>
    <li>Managers should support 6-8 engineers:
    <ul>
      <li>Less == tech lead.
      <ul>
        <li>It is a role with limited career opportunities:
        <ul>
          <li>Too little management and too little technical.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>More == coach.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Managers of mangers should support 4-6 managers:
    <ul>
      <li>Less == underutilized, tempted to create their own work.</li>
      <li>More == coach.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>On-call requires 8 engineers.</li>
    <li>Teams smaller than 4 are not teams.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Staying on the path to high-performing teams.
  <ul>
    <li>States of a team:
    <ol>
      <li>Falling behind:
      <ul>
        <li>Backlog growing, low morale, hard work but little progress.</li>
        <li>Solution: hire more people.</li>
        <li>Tactical support:
        <ul>
          <li>Setting user expectations.</li>
          <li>Quick wins (for morale).</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li>Tactical support: ensure work is valued.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Slow process to move between stages.</li>
    <li>On hiring, fix one team at a time, not a bit on each.</li>
    <li>Move work, not people.</li>
    <li>Gatekeeper antipattern:
    <ul>
      <li>Having humans who perform gatekeeping activities creates very odd social dynamics, and is rarely a great use of a human&rsquo;s time.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>If you are overwhelmed with possible areas of improvements, agree with your manager on an explicit plan, and give yourself permission to do the rest poorly.</li>

      <li>Reduce opportunities.</li>
      <li>Are a local suboptimal.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Avoid exceptions:

      <li>Periodically, review policy with (1) in mind.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>How to say no to more work:
  <ol>
    <li>Explain current velocity and its constraint. Outcome, either:
    <ol>
      <li>You get more resources.</li>
      <li>Move to prioritization vs current work.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Prioritization vs current work:
    <ol>
      <li>Document all incoming tasks.</li>
      <li>Develop guiding principles on how work is selected.</li>

  <li>Almost every internal problem can be traced back to a missing or poor relationship:
  <ul>
    <li>Start debugging problems from the relationship angle.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>With the right people, any process works, and with the wrong people, no process works.</li>
  <li>When:
  <ul>
    <li>Rapid growing: execution is more important than new ideas.</li>

      <li>Never manage up.</li>
      <li>Optimize locally.</li>

      <li>Not spending time building relationships.</li>
      <li>Define their role too narrowly</li>
      <li>Forget your manager is a human being.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>More experienced:
    <ul>
      <li>Do what worked in previous company.</li>
      <li>Spend too much time building relationships.</li>
      <li>Assume hiring can solve any problem.</li>
      <li>Abscond rather than delegate.</li>
      <li>Become disconnected from ground truth.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Both:
    <ul>
      <li>Mistake team size for impact.</li>
      <li>Mistake title for impact.</li>

      <li>Dont trust the team enough to delegate.</li>
      <li>Let other people manage your time.</li>
      <li>Only see problems and not celebrate successes.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>To grow as a manager, purse growth in scope rather than # people you manage.</li>
</ul><h1><a name="ch-5"></a>Chapter 5 - Culture</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To make your peers your team:
  <ol>
    <li>Must be aware of each others work.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Version controlled.</li>
  <li>Self-service.</li>
  <li>Restricted secrets.</li>
  <li>Default to production.</li>
  <li>Fail fast.</li>
  <li>No logic.</li>
  <li>Staging == production.</li>
  <li>Avoid &ldquo;isDevEnv?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Preconfigured local dev.</li>
  <li>Minimal.</li>
</ol><h2>Version controlled</h2><p>Same as code and infrastructure, configuration should be version controlled, so that you know who, when, how, why and what, and changes can be easily reviewed and rolled back.</p><h2>Self-service</h2><p>Ticketing systems to change configuration in production? Meh.</p><p>The team owning the service is already making any code changes that they want, so allowing them to change some configuration is not riskier.</p><p>If you really need gatekeeping, the owning team should be able to create pull requests with the required changes for the gatekeepers to approve/merge, reducing the chances of miscommunication.</p><h2>Restricted secrets</h2><p>Secrets that everybody can read are no secrets. Reduce your risks by restricting who can see and change which secrets.</p><h2>Default to production</h2><p>When adding some new configuration, always set the default to the production value.</p><p>This will avoid the most common issue with configuration: ‚ÄúOh, the app does not start because we forgot to set the configuration for ‚Ä¶‚Äù </p><p>And never ever default to some dev or testing value. Never ever.</p><p>Obviously, only default if it is safe. You don‚Äôt want to be sending emails to your real clients, connecting to your production data stores and such if some dev forgets to configure their local environment properly. </p><p>If not safe, the safe value is no default. In this case, add the production configuration as soon as possible. Do not wait for the code release. </p><h2>Fail fast</h2><p>Validate the configuration at start time, and crash the application if any value is missing or it has the wrong type.</p><h2>No logic</h2><p>Avoid any logic related to manipulating configuration, like string manipulation, url building or splitting. </p><p>It is less likely that you are be able to test it, and if the logic fails in production it will be harder to find out, especially for secret values.</p><h2>Staging == production</h2><p>The principle to make staging as similar as production includes configuration.</p><p>Especially important if you broke the ‚Äúno logic‚Äù principle.</p><h2>Avoid ‚ÄúisDevEnv?‚Äù</h2><p>All config usually start with a simple ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù configuration variable, that will sprinkle your codebase with ‚ÄúisDevEnv?‚Äù conditionals.</p><p>But soon enough, your app will be run in new environments (CI, test, staging, demo, training, load testing, hotbugfix-33, KafkaPoC, other team&rsquo;s local dev) and it will not be so clear what is dev and what is not.</p><p>So prefer explicit configuration variables to avoid implicit coupling of a bunch of behaviors to one configuration variable. </p><h2>Preconfigured local dev</h2><p>A big chunk of your configuration exists just for the local development environment, so given that most configuration is going to default to production values, it is important to make it easy to set up, add and update that configuration in every developer‚Äôs box.</p><p>My preferred approach is still a <a href="/2017/09/01/a-docker-compose-environment/#content">dockerized local environment</a>.</p><h2>Minimize configuration</h2><p>Less config, less chance for bugs. Same as code! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>!</p>
<hr/><p>In case you wonder, in our production incident we committed three sins: defaulted to a dev value, logic in config, and staging different from production.</p><p>Why sin once when you can do it thrice for the same price?</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
